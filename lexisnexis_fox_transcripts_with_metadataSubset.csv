Kennedy Jr. Fox News, AMERICA'S NEWSROOM9:00 AM EST, NEWS; International, 522words",U.S. Federal; Texas,"BILL HEMMER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Now this exclusive, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. sitting down with FOX News about the ongoing measles outbreak in parts of the U.S. and more. And Dr. Marc Siegel did the interview. He joins us now. And, Doc, what did you learn? DR. MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, I sat down with RFK Jr., Secretary RFK Jr., and he talked to me about what's going on, on the ground in West Texas and what HHS is doing there. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR., U.S. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY: What we're trying to do is really to restore faith in government and to make sure that we are there to help them with their needs, and not particularly to dictate what they ought to be doing. Right now, we have -- we're delivering vitamin A. We are providing assistance, if people need ambulance rides. There's a very -- Gaines County, where most of the cases occurred, is a very remote... (END VIDEO CLIP) SIEGEL: So I asked him about the current government response to the measles outbreak, and he said more is being done and he's sending CDC boots on the ground in Texas. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KENNEDY: They have treated most of the patients, actually, over 108 patients in the last 48 hours, and they're getting very, very good results, they report from budesonide, which is a steroid. It's a 30-year-old steroid, and clarithromycin and also cod liver oil, which has high concentrations of vitamin A and vitamin D. (END VIDEO CLIP) SIEGEL: According to the Texas Department of State Health Services, mostly unvaccinated children are the ones becoming infected. With the most recent CDC data showing vaccination exemptions for kindergartners during the 2023-2024 school year, we're at an all-time high. Kennedy has long questioned the safety and effectiveness of the MMR and other vaccines, but with the rapid spread of the disease, HHS has sent 2,000 doses of the MMR vaccine to Texas. And Kennedy acknowledged in an op-ed for FOX News Digital the role the measles vaccine plays in community immunity, but he added that the decision to vaccinate remains a personal one. With a startling number of patients being treated in the past two days, Kennedy spoke to me about other measures in addition to vaccination. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KENNEDY: We're going to do what's right for the American people. We're going to be honest with the American people for the first time in history about what actually -- about all of the tests and all the studies, what we know, what we don't know. We're going to tell them. And that's going to anger some people who want an ideological approach to public health. (END VIDEO CLIP) SIEGEL: Kennedy says there's a critical need for vaccines for community immunity, but he also says it's a matter of personal choice. Bill, he completely debunked the story in Politico that says his communications director resigned because of a personal conflict with him. He says he never even met the guy -- Bill. HEMMER: OK, so more to come on that. We will see what he says from here on out. Doc, nice going. SIEGEL: Thanks, Bill. HEMMER: Dr. Marc Siegel with that exclusive, thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""FOX NEWS @ NIGHT"" is next. I'm Greg Gutfeld. I love you, America. TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANCHOR: Good evening. I'm Trace Gallagher. It's 11:00 p.m. on the East Coast, 8:00 here in Los Angeles, and this is America's late news, FOX NEWS @ NIGHT. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And splash down. Crew-9 back on Earth. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Elon Musk save the U.S. space program. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: On behalf of SpaceX, welcome home. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I wasn't involved in any conversations with the previous administration. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We stopped flying astronauts on space shuttle in 2011. JOEL MONTALBANO, SPACE OPS MISSION DIRECTORATE, NASA: It was clear we have a request from the current administration, and the results you saw were -- is what we saw today with the landing of Crew-9. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: And breaking tonight, they are back on Earth. American astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, finally rescued after spending nine months on the Space Station. It was a team effort between the Trump administration, Elon Musk, and SpaceX. And moments ago, Elon Musk doubling down on the claim that President Biden left them behind. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ELON MUSK, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, SPACEX, TESLA, AND TWITTER: SpaceX could have brought the astronauts back after a few months at most, and we made that offer to the Biden administration, it was rejected for political reasons, and that's just a fact. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: Meantime, Democrats trying to put up a united front. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you still have confidence in Senator Schumer to lead the Democratic Caucus in the Senate? REP. NANCY PELOSI, (D-CA): I do. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE). PELOSI: I do. I do. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: But clearly, there is trouble in paradise. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD, CO-HOST, THE BREAKFAST CLUB: The party is in shambles. The party is in disarray. The party has no leadership. The party has no messaging. So, I wouldn't even speak for the party and try to act like the party has it all together, because guess what, we all have eyes and we all have ears, and we can see that they don't have any direction. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: And President Trump finally releasing 80,000 pages of JFK assassination files, fulfilling another major campaign promise. We'll be the first to break them down in moments. Plus, Republicans pushing back against the liberal judge presiding over the Tren de Aragua deportation case. And President Trump had this to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You look at his other rulings, I mean rulings unrelated. But having to do with me, he's a lunatic. I think some of it's for the publicity. They love the publicity. All of a sudden, they're on the front page of every newspaper, but they have no right to be. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: Bill Melugin is live with more on the deportation battle. Bill, good evening. BILL MELUGIN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Trace, good evening to you as well. In a court filing today, the Trump administration, answered a series of questions that a federal judge said they had to answer, regarding the deportations of alleged gang members to El Salvador. The Trump DOJ says that a total of three planes took off to El Salvador after President Trump's proclamation of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, and that they did not violate federal judge Boasberg's order, specifically, DOJ says, in part, ""Two of those planes departed U.S. territory and airspace before 7:25 p.m. Eastern. The third plane departed after that time, but all individuals on that third plane had Title 8 final removal orders, and thus were not removed solely on the basis of the proclamation at issue."" Now, tonight, in an interview with Laura Ingraham, President Trump slammed the judge's effort to block those flights. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: He actually said we shouldn't be able to take criminals, killers, murderers. Horrible. The worst people, gang members, gang leaders -- that we shouldn't be allowed to take them out of our country? Well, that's a presidential job. That's not for a local judge to be making that determination. (END VIDEO CLIP) MELUGIN: And President Trump has also called for that judge to be impeached. That's something Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts is throwing some cold water on. He put a statement out, which says, in part, ""For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to a disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose."" Republican Congressman Brandon Gill did end up filing articles of impeachment against Judge Boasberg, however. He is accusing the judge of abusing his power by trying to siege power from the executive branch. Trace. GALLAGHER: Bill Melugin. Bill, thank you. Let's bring in Fox News contributor Jason Chaffetz and Axiom Strategies' Erin Maguire. Erin, welcome back to you, and we love the new name. It's great for you. But Jason, to you first on this. The Chief Justice John Roberts said this about calls to impeach the judge who wants to keep Tren de Aragua in the country. Quoting here: ""For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that process."" And President Trump said this about the judge on Laura Ingraham, a short time ago. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: We have very bad judges, and these are judges that shouldn't be allowed. I think they -- I think, at a certain point, you have to start looking at, what do you do when you have a rogue judge? The judge that we are talking about, he is -- look at his other rulings. I mean, rulings unrelated. But having to do with me, he is a lunatic. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: Jason, what's your take on this? JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: I was on the House Judiciary Committee for eight years, although, I'm not an attorney. With all due respect to the chief justice, one of the remedies that is afforded is the ability to impeach somebody. And so, they have to go through a process. It's a rigorous process. It's difficult. It rarely gets invoked, but it too, is a remedy to deal with somebody who has gone rogue, and if it's determined that he has it and you can't get the votes, then, he won't be impeached. But it is a remedy. GALLAGHER: Yes. John Yoo, also weighed in on this today, Erin, and he was talking about, maybe the other side of this argument. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN YOO, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL, DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE: I actually think the Justice Department is right on this one. I think that district judges only have the power over people who happen to appear in their court. They don't have the ability to tell the entire federal government how to run their personnel policies or who they can hire and fire. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: I mean, the prospect of telling a plane in international airspace, you got to turn back around and bring those people back, Erin? ERIN MAGUIRE, AXIOM STRATEGIES: Yes, that would be a real expense. Their use of a district court judge to rule over the federal government and decide not only for the federal government, but foreign affairs on behalf of the president and the federal government, that seems like a large reach. So, that does seem like a strong argument by the Department of Justice going into this. And I do think that both points here are correct. On the argument and on Jason Chaffetz's point there regarding impeachment being a remedy that is allowed by the legislature. These are both sound arguments being made right now, but the left wants to try to weaponize them to scare people from the reality that what Donald Trump did was send criminal terrorists away from this nation, and that makes us a stronger country. GALLAGHER: Meantime, moving onto saving money now, I want to put the DOGE tracker up on the -- up on the screen. You can see $115 billion in saving. That goes to about $714 per taxpayer. Elon Musk on Sean Hannity had the following to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MUSK: Really, we're just implementing the will of the people, and we've got this window where we can finally take corrective action. We can fix the government, fix the country, and create a great future. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: I mean, the judges are against him, Jason, but the people are with him. You see the polls, the people, the American voters are with him and DOGE. CHAFFETZ: Right. Yes, that was the mandate that was given by Donald Trump. He is the president of the United States. He was duly appointed to this position. He's rooting out waste, fraud, abuse, something the Democrats supposedly say they are opposed to and that they wanted to get rid of, too. But now, that it's Donald Trump, of course, you know, they've had a change of heart. (CROSSTALK) GALLAGHER: Yes. CHAFFETZ: No longer do they want to get rid of the way of the waste, fraud, abuse. He is doing the right thing. (CROSSTALK) GALLAGHER: Yes. CHAFFETZ: Elon Musk, look at everything he does, it's amazing. GALLAGHER: Right. I mean, the display just from the space thing tonight, and you go on from there, and his cars are being attacked in dealerships, and it's kind of unbelievable. Very quickly on this, Erin, for you. Dan Hoffman, who was station chief of the CIA. He thinks the talks between Trump and Putin today were encouraging. What do you think? MAGUIRE: I think they were as well. Remember, when Donald Trump has been discussing the diplomacy with this, he has talked about this in a tiered approach and making sure that there are security assurances that can be made. Now, that there is infrastructure being protected in Ukraine, these are stronger security assurances to move toward peace negotiations. This is everything he has talked about. Again, strong diplomatic efforts seem to be moving toward a peaceful result. (CROSSTALK) GALLAGHER: Yes. Boy, I mean, we can only hope, but it -- but it does look like it's more than we thought it was this time last night. Erin Maguire, Jason Chaffetz, thank you, both. Meantime, those at the left cannot wait to fact check White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, so much so that a conservative media watchdog says she has already passed Jen Psaki's total after less than two months on the job. Marianne Rafferty is live to break down the numbers. Marianne, good evening. MARIANNE RAFFERTY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Good evening, Trace. Well, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has only been on the job for a couple of months, but has already been fact checked by PolitiFact, a nonpartisan fact checking web site, three times, most recently for this statement. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAROLINE LEAVITT, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Tariffs are a tax hike on foreign countries, that, again, have been ripping us off. Tariffs are a tax cut for the American people. RAFFERTY (voice over): Now, PolitiFact called Leavitt's statement, false, writing, ""Virtually, all economists characterize tariffs as tax hikes rather than tax cuts because much of the additional cost of the tariff is passed on to consumers through higher prices."" White House Spokesperson Taylor Rogers, responding in a statement to Fox News Digital, writing, in part, ""PolitiFact's, so-called reporters are not fact checkers, they are left-wing crusaders dedicated to spinning the truth, perpetrating lies, and promoting the Democrats' radical agenda."" (END VIDEO CLIP) RAFFERTY: For some comparison, Leavitt's democratic predecessors, Jen Psaki and Karine Jean-Pierre were only fact-checked by the organization two and four times during their entire respective tenures. Trace. GALLAGHER: ""COMMON SENSE"" has thoughts about this as well. Marianne, thank you. Well, the FOX NEWS @ NIGHT ""COMMON SENSE DEPARTMENT"" would like to lay out the facts about the fact checks. Turns out the current White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, has been fact checked more in 56 days than Biden press secretary Jen Psaki was fact-checked in 478 days. Psaki had two fact checks. Leavitt now has three. Karine Jean-Pierre, who was press secretary for 982 days, was fact checked only four times. So, if ""COMMON SENSE"" did the math correctly, Karoline Leavitt is on pace to be fact-checked 52 times by PolitiFact, or politifiction (PH), as some would say. Except PolitiFact swears it is unbiased, although, it appears they are using a biased barometer, very similar to Judge Roy Bean, who said lies aren't lies, unless you don't like the liar. Heck, PolitiFact gave Jen Psaki a true rating. That's the highest rating for saying this during COVID. Quoting here, ""You are 17 times more likely to go to the hospital if you're not vaccinated, and 20 times more likely to die."" PolitiFact confirmed that statement by using data from the Centers for Disease Control, not data confirmed by the CDC, mind you, it was data suggested by the CDC, and indicated by the CDC, kind of like Joe Biden indicating, or suggesting the laptop was fake. ""Common Sense"" thinks it's noble to seek the truth. But when it comes to the team in blue, can we start using facts to check facts? Let's bring in political commentators, James Klug and Avery Warwick. Great to have you on tonight. James, it looks like Karoline Leavitt really is on pace now to be fact- checked 12 times more than KGB, 24 times more than Jen Psaki, and there, oh, we are -- we are right down the middle and bias. It's crazy. JAMES KLUG, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Right. It's really been a pretty open secret for a while now, now that fact checkers serve as sort of a Democrat Party lap dog weaponized against conservatives. I mean, Democrats have been able to lie with impunity, where Republicans are held to an impossible standard. I mean, they are even -- they've even been fact-checking memes on conservative Instagram accounts. So, that doesn't solidify them as a joke nowadays. I don't know what does. GALLAGHER: Yes. Meantime, Avery, Chuck Schumer today -- well, I mean, I told him not to, but he went on ""The View"" anyway, and he got in this little back and forth. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SUNNY HOSTIN, HOST, ABC NEWS: We are friends, but I think you caved. I think you and nine other Democrats caved. I don't think you showed the fight that this party needs right now. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): I'd say, Sunny, no one wants to fight more than me, and no one fights more than me. We got to fight smart. You have two choices. One, bad, the other devastating. One chops off one of your fingers. The other chops off your arm. JOY BEHAR, CO-HOST, THE VIEW, ABC: Your own party saying, that's to go. SCHUMER: Yes. Here's I'm saying, I'm the best leader for the Senate. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: Don't you love Chuck Schumer lying to his own team? Avery? AVERY WARWICK, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: They are leaderless, rudderless, and unhinged. They have gone so far to the left that they can't even make sense of what they're saying anymore. GALLAGHER: Yes. I mean, it's one of those things where you think. And by the way, there was more. He went on for a while. We're going to -- (CROSSTALK) WARWICK: It was crazy. GALLAGHER: Some more later on. Here is Jon Stewart on Democrats, saying that they are staying on the very same path. Watch him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JON STEWART, HOST, THE DAILY SHOW, COMEDY CENTRAL: You're going to keep at it. Keep at it. Keep at it. Keep at it. At what? This was it! Apparently, the grand plan is Dems keep fecklessly complaining until the 48 approval comes down to 40, which is a plan. You're at 7 percent. Your approval is only seven points above where it turns red and goes into low power mode. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: But what he's missing here, James is that the Democratic Party wants them to be the resistance. I mean, it's not like they are going against party. They want the Democratic Party to be the resistance and nothing else. KLUG: Yes, they want it to be the resistance, even if it affects them negatively, right? GALLAGHER: Right. KLUG: Like, for example, you know, rejecting a shutdown. That would have going into a shutdown would have shifted the focus from the media, from Donald Trump and Elon Musk over to the Democrat-led shutdown. We've seen the abysmal approval ratings for the Democratic Party. Those numbers would have likely plummeted from there. GALLAGHER: Yes. Meantime, you had Tim Walz. He's kind of sort of back on the, I guess, the pseudo campaign trail. Today, the former V.P. candidate was on Gavin Newsom's podcast. Yes. Gavin Newsom has a podcast, talking about young men moving toward being Republicans. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D-CA): So, I think, it's one of the reasons we're losing so many men. And again, it's multi-ethnic. It's not just white men. We're losing them. We're losing them to these guys online. We're losing them people that I bring on this podcast as well. That's why I brought -- (CROSSTALK) GOV. TIM WALZ, (D-MN), VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: These are bad guys, though. NEWSOM: I (INAUDIBLE) WALZ: These are bad guys. NEWSOM: But they exist, and we can deny they exist. They exist. Not only they exist, they persist. And they are actually influencing young kids every single day. And they move it -- WALZ: How do we pushed -- how do we push some of those guys back under a rock? (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: So, the fascinating thing about this, Avery, is you have Tim Walz, saying these are bad -- talking about young men who happen to vote for Trump. These are bad guys. How do we push them under the rock? And you have Gavin Newsom kind of agreeing with him, you know? And that's the saddest part about the whole thing. It's still the same thing where, yes, they are evil and we are not. WARWICK: Look, the left means to go back to being centrist. They need to find a path towards the center, and it's a no-win situation for them, because anytime, any of their leaders try to get back to center, it doesn't work. Their party turns on them. GALLAGHER: Yes. Avery Warwick, James Klug, thank you both. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SUBBARAYUDU KONANKI, FATHER OF SUDIKSHA KONANKI: Just with deep, sad and sadness, heavy, have you heard that we are coming to the terms with the fact that our daughter has done, this is incredibly difficult for us to process. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: Yes, it is heart rending. The parents of missing American student, Sudiksha Konanki, now asking Dominican authorities to declare her dead, so, they can grieve her loss. Let's bring in former FBI special agent and Fox News contributor Nicole Parker. Just hard to watch, Nicole. You see that. You see the anguish is just so hard to watch. But the family is -- I think the family has resolved that they don't believe that job that Joshua Riibe was involved in this. And I think the Dominican authorities also, you know, they've let him go. There -- they said he is free to go. Do you think it's the right move? I mean, he did change his story a couple of times, but it didn't really look like he was ever truly involved, Nicole. What do you think? NICOLE PARKER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Again, as an FBI agent, I've seen things where they may not have looked like they were involved, and in the end, they actually were involved. And so, it's very difficult to conduct investigations like this. But obviously, he was at the mercy of the host country, which is the Dominican Republic, and they needed to keep him there, I believe, in their opinion, because once they ended the questioning, and once he was set free and sent back to the United States, if they had additional questioning and wanted to bring him back, or if they ever ended up wanting to charge him, he would have to be extradited, and we all know that that's a lengthy process, and so, I think that they kept in there as long as they could. But again, his lawyer came out and said, you know what, this is not appropriate. This is not right. And the judge did agree, and they're saying, look, he has not been charged with anything, and he is only a person of interest, and let's let him go. But again, these investigations are difficult to prove. GALLAGHER: Yes. PARKER: The family does believe that she drowned. I personally believe that she drowned as well. But that's not mutually exclusive that someone drowned and there was no foul play. So, again, very difficult to prove without a body. GALLAGHER: Yes. PARKER: If the body ever had been found, then you would have to actually prove that there was major trauma to the body that would indicate that there was foul play. So, again, very difficult to prove, but I commend those that have conducted this investigation, and God bless her family. (CROSSTALK) GALLAGHER: Yes. PARKER: It's very tragic. GALLAGHER: Yes, you're exactly right on that. Meantime, another Tesla business attack. This one happened in Las Vegas. We got the video. We're going to show you the video. We've also got Elon Musk kind of talking about these attacks, Nicole, and he said the following. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MUSK: It's really come as quite a shock to me that there is this level of really hatred and violence from the left. I was -- thought that the left, you know, Democrats were supposed to be the party of empathy, the party of caring, and yet, they're burning down cars. They are firebombing dealerships. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: Yes, they were the party of clean cars, and now, they want to burn them. I mean, they become the party of violence. Nicole. PARKER: Yes, as big as fans are now as big as haters. I'd call it, Musk Derangement Syndrome, MDS. I mean, it is in full force. This is evil and this is hate for an individual, and they are taking it out on his car dealerships. But what I do find refreshing, as tragic as it is, is that Pam Bondi, the Department of Justice, Kash Patel, and the FBI are full force getting to the bottom of these incidents. The fact that they are occurring across the nation in various locations around the same time frame, I do not believe is the coincidence. I would not be shocked if these are all related and if they're being funded by the same individuals. But again, I believe that under Garland and Christopher Wray, we probably would even see an investigation to this, because I continuously saw them turn a blind eye to those on a certain -- the certain side of the political spectrum. And so, again, I'm glad to see that justice is fair and that Elon Musk, he deserves to be protected, and so, do his car dealerships. This is absolutely unacceptable. GALLAGHER: Yes. PARKER: It is not American, and they must be held accountable, and there is a zero-tolerance policy in America now. GALLAGHER: I got to go, but I want to get your very quick opinion on this, Nicole. A few things we found in the release of the of the JFK assassination files. Put this on the screen. In September, October, 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald,"" approved the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City -- are sorry, ""approached the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City in an attempt to get a visa allowing him to return to the USSR. And then, Oswald was a poor shot too. The file also reflected, ""Oswald was a poor shot when he tried firing in the USSR."" Are you fascinated by this, Nicole? I got to go, but I just want to get to get your take on what you're looking for. PARKER: I do think it's fascinating. I mean, there are 80,000 files. The vast majority of them had already been released, but I do appreciate that President Trump is keeping his word. He is all about transparency. Americans have been very curious about this. There have been conspiracy theories out there, and it's time for them to set the record straight that they can look at whatever information they deem interesting. And again, I think it is the right thing to do. Mike Pompeo had advised Trump not to do this, and Trump has come in, in his second administration and said, no, this is the time I appreciate -- (CROSSTALK) GALLAGHER: Yes. PARKER: Appreciate Tulsi Gabbard, you know, getting in there and making sure that this happened on the deadline. And now, Americans can see for themselves. GALLAGHER: Lay it all out there. Lay it all out there. Let Americans take a look. Nicole Parker, great to have you on as always. Coming up, more information on exactly how Trump supporters are pushing back against the so-called activist judges, who keep ruling against him, again and again. And Americans captivated by the SpaceX splashdown in the Gulf of America. We'll have an update on the astronauts finally, back on U.S. soil. And later in the ""NIGHTCAP"" -- (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MUSK: The SpaceX could have brought the astronauts back after a few months at most. And we made that offer to the Biden administration. It was rejected for political reasons, and that's just a fact. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: Two NASA astronauts stuck in space under the Biden administration, finally made it home tonight. Thanks to SpaceX. Elon Musk, accusing Biden of delaying the mission for political reasons. Others disagree. What do you think? Was it political or were there legitimate reasons to delay? Let us know X and Instagram @tracegallagher in the ""NIGHTCAP"". (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GALLAGHER: Breaking tonight, astronaut Suni Williams, Butch Wilmore, back on Earth tonight, after being stranded in space for more than nine months. Their return from the International Space Station, highlighted by a gentle splashdown in the Gulf of America. Here is how the real-life drama unfolded. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: The stranded astronauts have just re- enter Earth's atmosphere. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The Dragon capsule, just minutes ago, was going over 17,000 miles per hour, and now, gently coasting -- UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: 200 meters. Brace for splashdown. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We're going to stand by for splashdown located in the Gulf of America. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And splashdown Crew-9 back on Earth. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Nick, Alex, Butch, Suni, on behalf of SpaceX, welcome home. JEANINE PIRRO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Thank God for the brilliance of people like Elon Musk. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We can see dolphins, actually, who want to come and play with Dragon. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The side hatch is open for the first time since September. We do see crew nine some happy waves, smiles all around back on Earth. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We can see folks on board clapping as our first crew member. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And that is NASA astronaut Nick Hague, commander of Crew-9. Some smiles, thumbs up, and a wave. Can't get any better than that. STEVE STICH, MANAGER, COMMERCIAL CREW PROGRAM, NASA: This has been nine months in the making, and I couldn't be prouder. MUSK: This is a moment of optimism about the future, a moment of excitement about the future, and it portends great things for America and humanity in space. LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Would you defy a court order? Does that -- we all know that. That was -- (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: No, I never -- I never did defy a court order. INGRAHAM: And you wouldn't in the future. TRUMP: No, you can't do that. However, we have bad judges. We have very bad judges. And these are judges that shouldn't be allowed. I think they -- I think at a certain point you have to start looking at, what do you do when you have a rogue judge. The judge that we're talking about, he is -- look at his other rulings. I mean, rulings unrelated. But having to do with me, he is a lunatic. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: Well, the president doubling down right here on Fox News tonight on Laura Ingraham show, in his administration's deportations of Venezuelan gang members. Let's bring in criminal defense attorney and federal litigator Vik Bajaj, along with former Pinal County, Arizona Sheriff Mark Lamb. Thank you both for coming on tonight. Vik, to you first. I mean, that the president, you heard him there. Calls these people rogue judges. What's your opinion on all these decisions kind of going against the administration? Why? And what do you make of it? VIK BAJAJ, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: I hate to say that they're expected. You know it should be judge Joe Schmo made a decision, not Judge Joe Schmoe, a Democrat, made a decision. And it's amazing how you can compartmentalize this. You know, it's very interesting because Donald Trump is saying -- President Trump is saying, hey, you know what, we have rogue judges, we need to do something. I'm not going to violate a court order, but we need to do something about it. And this dovetails into the impeachment power. You know, 15 federal judges have been impeached. Eight of them were actually removed after a two thirds vote by the Senate, going all the way back to 1802. Samuel Chase is probably one in 1805, that's saying, hey, I was impeached for political bias by the Jeffersonian Republicans. He wasn't eventually removed, but he was impeached. So, when we hear that it is not a constitutional remedy, that's wrong. And perhaps this is President Trump leaning into the turn saying, we need to move forward aggressively for impeachment. GALLAGHER: So, the Supreme Court Justice, you know, Chief Justice was kind of weighing in, telling Trump not to weigh in. Maybe both should have, I don't know, maybe the remedy is -- BAJAJ: (INAUDIBLE) weigh in. I mean, you have a Supreme Court justice saying, hey, by the way, I'm not naming names, but impeachment is not the right remedy. That's a direct attack towards President Trump. The same way, he had a direct attack towards President Trump in 2018 when President Trump targeted an implication against another federal district judge. GALLAGHER: Meantime, Sheriff, Bill Melugin wrote the following, quoting here, ICE Boston has arrested a 59-year-old Guatemalan illegal alien charged with two counts of indecent assault and battery against a Massachusetts child after he was released from local custody by the Boston Municipal Court, which ignored ISIS detainer. I mean, Sheriff, it's amazing to me that Boston would rather have a child sex offender on the streets than do anything that would comply or cooperate with the Trump administration. MARK LAMB, FORMER PINAL COUNTY, ARIZONA SHERIFF: Yes, it is amazing. It should be amazing to all Americans. But sadly, there are not just Mayor Wu in Boston, but we saw from Chicago, from Denver, from all over the country. We're seeing mayors and other politicians getting in the way protecting really bad people, protecting -- look, we've got them fighting for these people from TDA, from terrorists, being removed from the country. I just don't understand, and I don't think the majority of the Americans understand it. And to your point on the judges, this is partly in parcel with the judges, because the judges are not getting stiff enough sentences, or no bail or in some cases, they're just ROR which is on recognizance release, this is a problem. And what is the recourse for going after a bad judge who continues to make one bad ruling after another, going against his authority and the Constitution. So, look, this is all -- this is a problem all the way around. I know I rambled on, but judges are part of this problem. The mayors were part of this problem. We have to hold people accountable. GALLAGHER: Meantime, The Guardian writes the following headline here, judge rules against Musk and DOGE, finding USAID shutdown likely violated the Constitution. Elon Musk was on ""HANNITY"" a bit earlier. He had the following to say about DOGE. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ELON MUSK, CEO, TESLA MOTORS: It turns out, when you take away people's, you know, the money they're receiving fortunately, they get very upset. The reason I'm here is because I'm very worried about America going back bankrupt due to the corruption of waste, and if we're going to do something about it, the ship of America is going to sink, and we're all on that ship. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: And it seems just to me, Vik, like justice is no longer blind. Lady Justice was supposed to be blind, right? And now it's not like that. You can shop for a judge. BAJAJ: It's almost a game, isn't it, Trace? I mean, it's sort of OK, let's start in the lower courts, whether it's a state court or a federal district court. Let's roll the dice. Let's see how it goes, and then let's depend on the circuit courts. And then let's eventually say we're always going to end up in the Supreme Court of the United States. The real fatal error with that is we shouldn't have th",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 these are criminal fraudsters that are raising the flag in serious disappointment here. And that says a lot reading between the lines. GALLAGHER: Yes, it really does. Fox news headline is the following, a well- known immigration activist who hid in a Colorado church for years to avoid deportation has been arrested, a move Denver Mayor Mike Johnston called Soviet-style persecution of political dissidents. I mean, it's every liberal newspaper, Sheriff, calls this woman grandmother. That's the headline, grandmother wants me to. She was supposed to be arrested and deported under Obama, and she kept avoiding it, and now they're blaming Trump for this whole thing. Your last thought on this, Sheriff? LAMB: Yes, my understanding is this woman had a lengthy record that she had been arrested or been charged in many other cases, and she actually went as far as to go to a church to hide from authorities, to escape the consequences of her actions. This is the type of people we're trying to root out of this country, but the left will continue to try to spin it against President Trump and his administration and his policies. GALLAGHER: Yes. Sheriff, Vik, thank you both. Coming up, President Trump's exclusive interview with Laura Ingraham, and what he said about his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin and their phone call today. And new undercover video shared with FOX NEWS @ NIGHT appears to show how some Columbia University students really feel about Israel, that's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GALLAGHER: Well, the president spoke with Vladimir Putin for more than an hour and a half today, and came away from the call with an agreement to begin negotiations for a cease fire in Russia's three-year-old war in Ukraine. The Senior National Correspondent Rich Edson live in D.C. with the details. Rich, good evening. RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Trace. The White House says Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed to a limited cease fire. And," """"The movement to peace will begin with an energy and infrastructure cease fire", as well as technical negotiations on implementation of a maritime cease fire in the Black Sea," full cease fire and permanent peace. These negotiations will begin immediately in the Middle East."""" The president says a wider cease fire now would have been difficult to negotiate. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP", PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Right now, you have a lot of guns pointing at each other, and a cease fire without going a little bit further would have been tough. We had a great call. It lasted almost two hours. Talked about a lot of things and toward getting it to peace. And we talked about other things also. EDSON (voice over): Russia says it will release 23 seriously wounded Ukrainian soldiers and agree to exchange 175 prisoners per side. Ukraine says Russia is still launching drone attacks against their country. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says," """"Today"," Putin effectively rejected the proposal for a full cease fire. It would be right for the world to respond by rejecting any attempts by Putin to prolong the war."""" (END VIDEOTAPE) EDSON (on camera): Zelenskyy says he wants sanctions on Russia and for Russia to stop attacking civilians as proof of its willingness to end this war. Russia wants to halt international aid to Ukraine. Ukraine wants security guarantees to prevent Russia from launching yet another attack", Trace. GALLAGHER: Rich Edson, live for us in D.C. Rich, thank you. Let's bring in former Special Envoy for combating anti-Semitism and delegitimization of Israel, Noa Tishby along with Admiral Mark Montgomery from the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Thank you both for coming on. Admiral, to you first, I want to play some more sound. Rich, played a little. I want to play more sound of the president talking tonight about his call with Vladimir Putin, watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: I think Russia wants to get along with the United States. I also think we're a much different country than we were just a few months ago. We're a country that's now respected. We were not respected. We were being laughed at. We had incompetent leadership. This was a war as an example that would have never happened if I were president. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: Are you encouraged as well by this, Mark? What do you think about this? RADM. MARK MONTGOMERY (RET.), FOUNDATION FOR DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACIES: Well, Trace, thanks for having me. I will say I'm encouraged. It's a 2.5 hour call. It means they had a lot of things to discuss. I am disappointed though that President Putin rejected the unconditional cease fire. The United States has spent a lot of time bringing Ukraine to the table with a maximum pressure campaign, and now Putin had a perfect opportunity to accept this. Instead, he's asking for things that are completely unrealistic in terms of a cessation of military support, a demobilization of the Ukrainian army, removal of intelligence sharing. I think it's really going to be time soon for President Trump to do a maximum pressure campaign on President Putin to get him to be quite as consensual and mailable (ph) as President Zelenskyy was last week. GALLAGHER: Yes, I think many have said it. It could be a battle ahead. Meantime, Benjamin Netanyahu said this about ending the cease fire. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: You would do what we are doing in the face of pure evil. Free societies have no choice but to fight. So, I want to assure all our friends around the world, Israel will fight, and Israel will win. We will bring our people home, and we will destroy Hamas. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: He's confident. But you talk to some of the families of the hostages, Noa, and they're not very confident. NOA TISHBY, FORMER ISRAELI SPECIAL ENVOY: If you were one of those families, you would have lost your mind. I know I would have lost my mind. It's completely unacceptable. But here's the thing. We have normalized in America, the fact that there are 59 hostages that Hamas, a terrorist organization, is holding and refusing to let go, let's not remember who started this war. Hamas is the one who started this war on October 7th. Hamas has the ability to end this war right now, and this is what needs to be done. This campaign right now was caused because of intelligence that we found out that Hamas is not only strengthening but planning to attack Israel again, obviously not as strong as October 7th attack, because they're weakened by a lot. And in addition to that, there was intelligence that a few of them were at the same place, at the same time. Israel had to take action. A terrible predicament. They need to be released. Hamas can end this war tomorrow. GALLAGHER: They could. I want to put this up on the screen. This is a FoxNews.com thing. I don't have it in front of me. Katie, (ph) maybe you can leave me on this. FoxNews.com we don't have it. We're talking about going after the Houthis, that Israel went after the Houthis. And what I want to know, Admiral, on this is, you know that Iran is backing Hezbollah, Iran is backing Hamas, Iran is backing the Houthis. But when Israel goes after the Houthis, it seems like it is one big step closer for Israel to Iran. MONTGOMERY: It is and also, Trace, one step closer for the United States to Iran. I think the United States striking the Houthi positions over the last three nights is a great campaign by President Trump and his central command leadership team, but really we need to hold the sponsors of the Houthis, the sponsors of Hamas, the sponsors of Hezbollah, that's Iran. We need to hold them accountable. I think we're getting to the point where the United States needs to do its own strike against Iran, just as Israel did in October of last year. GALLAGHER: Yes, I want to play some sound here. No, this is a pro-Israel influencer, Zach Sage Fox. He went undercover near Columbia, near Barnard College, and he had this back and forth with some of the students. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ZACH SAGE FOX, CONTENT CREATOR: Is there a lot of, like, pro-Hamas support here? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. FOX: Really? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Sure. FOX: Nice. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. FOX: Really? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think terrorists are some of those words that people hadn't actually thought about the meaning. FOX: Like, there's nuance in terrorism. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There's -- yes, like, there's nuance in terrorism. FOX: Is it more Zionist than, like, pro-Hamas at the school? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It was more pro-Hamas. FOX: Are you guys anti-Zionist? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I am personally anti-Zionist. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A good number especially at Barnard. FOX: There's a lot of like, pro-Hamas, like, I'm not alone. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You're not alone, completely not alone. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Zionists are just on a different level here. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Zionists are (EXPLETIVE DELETED) idiots. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't associate with Zionists. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: I mean, no, the things that people will say when they think they're saying it in friendly company, I mean, the horrific things that people will say, it's amazing. TISHBY: Yes, horrific, but not surprising at all. Sadly, we know that anti- Zionism is a new form of anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism is a shape shifting conspiracy theory, and today it takes the shape of the IDF is evil, the Zionists are evil, and Israel is evil. This is a part of what's been happening on campuses in America. It's a radicalization of the American public. And it's not just anti-Jewish and anti-Israeli, it's anti-American. COAD (ph), which is the organization on college campus on Columbia, was an organization that is calling for to end American imperialism. This is anti-American and I believe that the majority of American people actually understand that. GALLAGHER: Yes, Noa Tishby, Admiral Mark Montgomery, thank you both. Elon Musk says the safe return of two NASA astronauts should have happened a long time ago, claiming the Biden administration delayed the rescue for political reasons. Others disagree. What do you think? Was it a political move, or were there legitimate reasons to delay? Let us know X and Instagram @TraceGallagher, we're back with the nightcap crew, which includes you, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GALLAGHER: Back with the nightcap crew, Rich Edson, Marianne Rafferty, Bill Melugin, Mark Lamb, Vik Bajaj, Avery Warwick. Tonight's topic, political or practical, thanks to SpaceX, two astronauts stuck in space for more than 200 days are safely back on Earth. But Elon Musk says President Biden could have made it happen sooner. What do you think? Was it a delay because of political reasons or other reasons? Sheriff Lamb? LAMB: Well, you have to remind Biden every day that we had two astronauts stuck up in space for it to -- for him to do it. So, probably political, probably more lack of memory. But in the end, I want SpaceX to come get me, not NASA. GALLAGHER: Avery? AVERY WARWICK, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: No question in my mind, it was absolutely political. There's no one more pro humanity than Elon Musk and the left's hatred towards him. This only thing that can be unified is hating Musk and Trump. It's quite sad, actually. GALLAGHER: Rich Edson. EDSON: Well, Trace, it was back in August, where NASA, under the Biden administration, chose Elon Musk SpaceX over Boeing to do this, which set up all the amazing pictures we saw today, the return, the dolphins, everything that went on. NASA said it looked at doing this earlier, but because of cost concerns, they waited. And DOGE knows better than anybody else. We're looking at a cost now. GALLAGHER: Yes, that's exactly right. Bill? BILL MELUGIN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: I'm sure it's all a coincidence that they're back now, just like it's a coincidence we got our hostage back from Russia, just like it's a coincidence we got our guys back from Venezuela, just like it's a coincidence the borders closed now, it's all a coincidence. GALLAGHER: You need a bill to close that border. Marianne? MARIANNE RAFFERTY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I agree. I mean, when you hear that they had the opportunity to bring them back much sooner, it makes people think, why? Why not? GALLAGHER: Yes, Vik? BAJAJ: Toying with people's lives, it's unacceptable. And Bill, to your point, I mean, so many coincidences. It may be a pattern, perhaps? GALLAGHER: And while the political move is very appealing, I think it was more to maintain a predetermined schedule of launches. Steve, we can only assume, well, it just wasn't important to Joe. Also, his administration was never going to make Elon look good. Doc, maybe Biden kept forgetting they were up there to the sheriff's nod. Kimberly, it was political. Biden would have brought them home and claimed the credit for it. Deena, political for sure. Whatever made sense, he did the opposite. Peter, it was fear and a lack of confidence, plain and simple. Tim, 100 percent a political move. Biden didn't want Trump supporters getting credit for the rescue. Thank you for watching America's late News, FOX NEWS @ NIGHT. I'm Trace Gallagher in Los Angeles," we'll see you right back here again tomorrow night. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)"""

It's a win for the Trump administration and a win for America's security, the feds taking down an accused MS-13 gang leader just outside of Washington, D.C. Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel meeting with FBI agents early this morning before watching the operation unfold in real time. And FOX News had a front-row seat. Let's go right to David Spunt with the latest. DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Will. His is name is Henrry Josue Villatoro Santos, 24 years old, arrested at an apartment complex about 40 minutes southwest of Washington, D.C. It all happened early this morning. And, as you mentioned, we were there exclusively to watch it unfold. We arrived on scene around 4:30. We joined the attorney general, Bondi, FBI Director Patel as they got briefed to how this operation would go down. Now, while the armored trucks went into the neighborhood, the A.G., FBI director and others watched this unfold on multiple monitors, angles from the ground in the sky. Typically, you don't see an FBI director and an attorney general come to operations at 4:30 in the morning. The FBI director, along with DOJ support, recently set up a new task force in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KASH PATEL, FBI DIRECTOR: This is what can happen when you put good cops in good places to take on bad guys. And America should be watching this and we are proud to be here standing with these brave warriors. (END VIDEO CLIP) SPUNT: Now, we have photos to share from court documents that were just unsealed here in about the last hour or so. This man made his court appearance in the Northern District of Virginia, which is in Alexandria. One shows guns. The other shows suppressors, also known right there as silencers. The attorney general said violent crime will continue to be a focus, especially when it comes to gangs. Joining the FBI will was the ATF, Virginia State Police, ICE, and the Prince William County local police. They do this kind of thing multiple times a week, but this guy happened to allegedly be in one of the top 13 MS-13 -- top three MS-13 leaders. The reason they had a SWAT team in military-looking vehicles, they expected him to be armed, but luckily nobody was harmed. That was Attorney General Bondi talking about the -- quote -- ""unsung heroes"" and saying that our country is safer by taking on this specific person. Now, Will, he's charged with being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm. However, sources say they do expect more charges down the road. We see this from time to time. It's what's known kind of as a holding charge before others come down the pike -- Will. CAIN: David, a quick question for you. I know MS-13 is a major criminal organization out of El Salvador with a big presence in the United States. This guy, as you described him, a top three leader of MS-13. What type of organized crime is being perpetuated here, and I think primarily on the East Coast, but here in the United States, by MS-13? SPUNT: Drug trafficking, cartel-type trafficking, other types of violence certainly. They're looking at that. MS-13, Tren de Aragua are the two big ones, Will, that this administration is focused on. And while he was in the top three leadership, according to DOJ, in the country, they say that he ran operations for MS-13 on the East Coast, 24 years old. And when I was out there today speaking with these FBI agents and others that were undercover and that were working this operation literally all through the night, they said it really struck them the fact that this guy's 24 years old, but somehow was able to take that command status of such a well-known gang from El Salvador. And he is from El Salvador. CAIN: Yes, MS-13 often acting as foot soldiers, street-level gangsters for the Mexican drug cartels, but on their own right as their own entity, one of the most violent gangs in the Western Hemisphere. David Spunt, thank you so much. SPUNT: Thank you. CAIN: All right, now to this. President Trump announcing a 25 percent tariff on all cars and auto parts imported into the United States. That's set to start on April 2. Some Americans have doubts, a recent FOX poll showing more than half of voters think tariffs will make things more expensive and hurt the economy. So let's head over to the White House with senior counselor for trade and manufacturing Peter Navarro. Peter, great to see you here today. PETER NAVARRO, SENIOR WHITE HOUSE OFFICE TRADE AND MANUFACTURING ADVISER: Hey, Will. CAIN: Let's put you straight to some of those voters' concerns, some of those concerns of Americans about the rising price of potentially cars under these tariffs. NAVARRO: Well, tariffs are tax cuts. And what's going to happen here is, we're going to raise over $100 billion in tariffing auto imports, including the parts. And what the president is going to do in the tax bill that we're working on in Congress is he's going to provide a interest rate deduction for the auto loans when people buy American cars. So that's going to work that way. At the same time, we're lowering our gas prices. Every dollar of gas per gallon that you lower, that's about $1,000 more purchasing dollars for consumers. So we're going to take care of Americans, no question there. Plus, what we're going to do is create hundreds of thousands of jobs that are high- wage jobs for prosperity. The problem here, Will, and the reason why auto parts is so important in this tariffing policy is we have been turned from what once was the so- called arsenal of democracy in World War II, where we were a manufacturing powerhouse and our auto industry helped build all the trucks and jeeps and all the tanks, everything we needed, into simply an assembly operation for Germany, Japan, these other countries that send us their parts. And they have been able to capture our market, turn us essentially into colonies, by using cheating in their industrial policies. Let me give you an example. Let's do a couple of numbers; 16 million cars, vehicles that we import every year, half of those, half of those, Will, are imports. Now, of the other half, you think that would be the good news, but only half of that half is domestic content. So we're down to about 25 percent of essentially made-in-America content out of those 60 million parts. And the reason why this is so important is that the wages, the wages are 10 percent to 20 percent higher in these higher-value added parts. Let me give you an idea. It's called the power train. It's the engines, it's the transmissions, and the drivetrains that make the internal combustion engine car go, right? And those manufacturing elements have higher times, that you need more experience, more training. And the Germans and the Japanese in particular have by a matter of industrial policy and through cheating and subsidies and all sorts of stuff captured that. CAIN: Right. NAVARRO: It's like we only make 19 percent of the engines of all the cars we buy. Germany and Japan collectively are almost 50 percent of that, and the same thing with the transmissions. CAIN: OK, hold on real quick, Peter, because I want to make sure. I want to make sure. You're always -- you always lay it out well. And I mean that not gratuitously, but I mean that sincerely. You lay it out well. When you say tariffs, though, are a tax cut, not on their face, not in and of themselves. They are a tax, but what I hear you saying is, it's going to correspond with the tax cut for those that buy American cars. You want to provide a tax incentive in the new bill for those that buy American cars that you can write off as a tax credit that purchase. NAVARRO: Exactly. CAIN: And then, of course, there's the laudable goal, Peter, of bringing those jobs back home. And I think everybody agrees. Let's bring that manufacturing base back to America. Here's the big question. The pain that comes in the short term, perhaps with rising prices, how long until you see that manufacturing base return to America? NAVARRO: It's going to be very quick, and for a couple of reasons. One is, we have -- we're operating at about 65 percent capacity utilization now. That's very, very low. What that means is that there's a lot of room to run. And the beauty of the 25 percent tariff by President Trump is, he's basically set off a race among all the car manufacturers to get here first. So the best -- the companies that are going to do the best are the ones that are most rapid about getting here. So this is going to happen very quickly. And on the tax cut thing, I think it's really important. It's not just the interest rate deduction we're going to give on autos. The tariff program on aluminum, steel, cars, what we're going to look forward to next week, that's going to pay for the tax cut. What we're going to have is going to be the largest tax cut in American history. It's broad-based, middle-class, like the last one President Trump did. It's going to be thousands and thousands of dollars for middle-class families. And we're going to be better off. We're going to be better off because we have a strong manufacturing base to defend ourselves. We're going to have higher wages. We're going to have millions more jobs. And life's going to be good. It is a golden age. And this is why this is going to work. CAIN: I have heard -- no, it's important to hear the big picture. It is, because I don't think we can avoid that there's probably going to be some short-term pain. And President Trump has admitted as much. But to hear from you and the commerce secretary and others that the long- term vision is this is how it plays out, including, short term, we're going to see income tax reductions because you anticipate some revenue from tariffs. Always good to hear the big picture. Thank you, Peter Navarro. NAVARRO: Always a pleasure, will. You take care. CAIN: All right, take care. All right, it's a case of judicial deja vu. President Trump is battling the same district judge on the deportation flights now in a lawsuit about the Signal chat leak, Signal chat gate. But, first, we have a major update in the Las Vegas Tesla arson attack next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SPENCER EVANS, FBI SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE: There's nothing courageous or noble about firebombing private property and terrorizing your local community. The self-righteous mob that's cheering you on today to commit acts of violence on their behalf will leave you high and dry and forget about you tomorrow. And at the end of the day, you and you alone will be held responsible and face the prospect of a lengthy prison sentence. (END VIDEO CLIP) CAIN: So, a major development in the search for Tesla vandals, Las Vegas police making an arrest for what they're calling a targeted attack at a Tesla collision center last week; 36-year-old Paul Kim has been taking into custody on charges that include arson and possessing an explosive device. Let's bring in senior columnist at Townhall.com, Los Angeles trial lawyer, retired Army infantry colonel, and a very patient man who didn't make the show yesterday after we had a long debate with a Democratic congressman, but came back today very kindly, Kurt Schlichter. Hey, Kurt. KURT SCHLICHTER, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR: Hey. Thank you, Will. And great cross-examination of Jason Crow yesterday. It made me almost want to be a trial lawyer again, almost. CAIN: You sent me a nice note and said, I thought you never practiced. I thought you were never in a courtroom, Will. That looked like a cross- examination. Some, education sticks. Some of it is intuitive. Some of it is debating on ""First Take,"" Kurt. But I want to ask you about, this Tesla arrest. Here's the details from it at home. And the attack occurred on March 18, suspected use of a firearm to shoot surveillance cameras. He painted ""Resist"" on the doors. He used a Molotov cocktail, by the way, ended up setting on fire, damaging five vehicles, three totally, totally destroyed, Kurt. Here's what I'd love to know from you. What do you want to know about this guy? Now that he's arrested, what do you think is important for us to learn about this guy Paul Kim? SCHLICHTER: Well, Paul Kim with his dumb beard and his stupid hipster hat just decided to impress his friends. Now he's looking at a federal beef. This is serious stuff. And it has to be treated seriously, Will, because we cannot tolerate violence being brought into the political arena. Now, we saw that in Butler, where President Trump was wounded, and Corey Comperatore was killed. A couple other folks were wounded too. We have got to make a decision. Now, I have been -- I have served in countries where violence was a means of an end in politics. I don't want that here in my country. This guy has to learn his lesson and all his little hipster pals need to learn it too. CAIN: I will tell you what I want to know, Kurt. I want to know who he's connected to. I want to know if he has any funding, any support. I actually want to know also who he's inspired by, who he's been reading, who he's been listening to. I want to know how he felt eventually to be set into motion to start taking on political violence. Kurt, you are a lawyer. And this is important. I want to know this from you. So, Judge Boasberg of infamy now, the judge who shut down deportation flights from President Trump, set the preliminary injunction on the entire nation for deportation flights, has now been assigned in the federal District of Columbia, this Signal chat case, Kurt. He is going to -- there's been a lawsuit about what we just learned in the past week. He's going to be overseeing this case. And you know this stuff. These are supposed to be assigned randomly and probably buy a lottery in a computer system. What are the odds, Kurt? Like, how many federal judges are in that district that could have received these cases? Because this is his fourth. SCHLICHTER: Well, I could tell you the odds, about 6 percent. There are 18 judges in that particular district. And it suddenly went to him. Good -- goodness gracious. One time is bad luck. Two times is coincidence. Three times, that becomes enemy action. So let's see what happens here. I do admire the way Trump is using strategic patience on this. He -- and I wrote about it at Townhall on Monday. He is not coming out and saying, I'm going to defy all you federal judges. He's slowly and surely going through the appellate process, pushing. I have read many of the briefs from the DOJ and they're outstanding. Substantively, I think they're doing a great job. And the pressure is now on Chief John Roberts to make a decision about whether he wants to do what he thinks is going to protect his judiciary branch, which isn't going to protect it, or do what he really needs to protect it, which is to make it do its job, rein in these out-of-control district judges. CAIN: To your point on President Trump, just for what it's worth, here's what he put on TRUTH Social. ""How disgraceful is it that Judge James Boasberg has just been given a fourth Trump case, something which is statistically impossible."" You highlight, Kurt, that it's a 6 percent odds, one of 18 federal district judges who could have received the case. I only have like a minute, and I hate to open up this big, deep conversation in a minute, Kurt, but, again, you're an attorney. I have spoken to Darrell Issa this week. I have spoken to Congressman Chip Roy. They're both interested in a bill from Congress to limit the impact of district judge injunctions to their geographic jurisdiction. Now, they want to tweak it, and they may want to make it so you have to go to the appellate level or three-judge panel. But what do you think about Congress starting to limit the scope so you don't get these nationwide injunctions from district judges? SCHLICHTER: I would love it, but we're up against the filibuster. We're up against a 60 vote to close the debate margin in the Senate. And I don't think there are 10 Democrats who would vote for this, which is kind of crazy, because, as we found out, when you change the rules, you suddenly find the new rules are being applied to you. And when that happens, it hurts. CAIN: Right. SCHLICHTER: So, maybe they ought to think down the road to when they're back in power and how they really want the branches to work together, instead of this short-term ""I will show that Trump"" thinking that's brought him so much pain. CAIN: All right, Townhall.com's Kurt Schlichter, always great to see you. Again, thank you for coming back today. We missed you yesterday. Glad to have you here today on ""The Will Cain Show."" SCHLICHTER: Any time, Will. Thank you and your staff. CAIN: All right. Coming up, a Democrat state senator out with a very hot take. Women are athletically equal to men and face no biological disadvantages. I was at a middle school track meet yesterday, and I wondered then why did they raise the hurdles when the men started to run, the boys started to run? We debate it. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAIN: Pennsylvania Democrat State Senator Lindsey Williams sparked outrage at yesterday's Education Committee hearing. So today it's time for derision and mockery with her Opposition to the Save Women Sports Act, a bill that would keep transgender athletes out of women's sports. Now, here's her argument. Women face no biological disadvantages to men. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STATE SEN. LINDSEY WILLIAMS (D-PA): Female bodies are just as strong as -- fast and capable as male bodies. For what reason, other than political gain, are we spending time and taxpayer dollars on a completely made-up issue? I want all girls to know that there are elected officials like me who would never underestimate your ability to beat a boy at their own sport. (END VIDEO CLIP) (LAUGHTER) CAIN: Is there even a worthy response? I mean, there's a lot, but at the end is it even necessary? It wasn't on that day because the bill ultimately advanced in a 7-4 vote, but all the Democrats on that committee found that compelling. They voted no. This is a recent FOX poll shows 68 percent of Americans favor President Trump's policies banning trans athletes from participating in women's sports. And it comes also as one of the top bipartisan issues; 43 percent of Democrats actually support the ban. So, joining me now is nationally syndicated radio host Dana Loesch. Dana, I would challenge you. It's one of those things where it's so easy to respond and rebut that it becomes hard. It's so insane, it's hard to meet it with sanity. So I'm just going to share you one other thing that was said at that hearing. One of these people said, nobody stopped Shaq from competing against point guards. So, therefore, let dudes play against women. DANA LOESCH, CONSERVATIVE RADIO HOST: Oh, my gosh, Will. I'm just as -- this is just mind-numbingly idiotic that this lawmaker said this. And, by the way, you can tell that this chick clearly didn't letter in squat, because that's what somebody who never lettered in anything would actually say. I was a varsity athlete. I know you played sports. I -- yes, there are clearly obvious differences between the anatomy and physiology of a male compared to that of a woman. My specialty, Will, was the 1,600- and 3,200- meter, the mile and the two mile. And I was varsity. I'm not going to toot my own horn, but I was really good. I had a lot of endurance, but I tell you what. CAIN: Right. LOESCH: I actually did run with the J.V. boys, the J.V. boys as a varsity like multi-metal-winning athlete. I would get smoked by the varsity boys. And it's like that in every discipline. If we didn't have those differences, if men didn't go through puberty and have faster twitch muscle fibers and thicker bone density, taller, broader, built differently, hip alignment, gait, everything differently, then we would not have men's sports and women's sports. But as it is, science is real as much as this lawmaker wants to deny it. And there are obvious differences. CAIN: I love how she dresses up, by the way, that insanity, in, I believe in you girls. I don't doubt you. You can beat the boys. I want to get to this with you. Everybody's playing this today, Dana. And I'm going to play for you as well, because it was remarkable. It was Congressman Brandon Gill taking on NPR CEO Katherine Maher. And it was about how she said and behaved in the past and her now today testifying about the continued funding for NPR. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. BRANDON GILL (R-TX): Do you believe that America believes in black plunder and white democracy? KATHERINE MAHER, CEO, NPR: I don't believe that, sir. (CROSSTALK) GILL: You tweeted that in reference to a book you were reading at the time, apparently, ""The Case for Reparations."" MAHER: I don't think I have ever read that book, sir. GILL: You tweeted about it. You said you took a day off to fully read ""The Case for Reparations."" You put that on Twitter in January of 2020. (END VIDEO CLIP) CAIN: Now, Dana, as entertaining as that is, I want to play something that's a flashback for people back from 2022 to set you up here. I would've wanted to know if her swearing-in that day was actually valid because, if we go back to a TED Talk, she doesn't actually believe in the truth. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAHER: For our most tricky disagreements, seeking the truth and seeking to convince others of the truth might not be the right place to start. In fact, our reference for the truth might be a distraction that's getting in the way of finding common ground and getting things done. (END VIDEO CLIP) CAIN: Why might I believe she was telling the truth in front of Congress if she doesn't feel like it's a value necessity to tell the truth? LOESCH: That's a great point. And that is amazing. That's a million-dollar audio. I mean, I'm almost speechless. So she believes that you should just forego the truth just so that you can move along and get along. Well, that always works in progressives' favor. CAIN: And build consensus. LOESCH: Yes, it always works in her -- it always works in the left's favor, because they're the ones who demand that everyone else sacrifice the real truth at the altar of their truth, which is always some sort of fantastical made-up scenario. But that clip that you played, by the way, I thought that Brandon Gill, who's a congressman from Texas, really handled that well with a Gen X cynicism delivered in a Gen Z manner, in her face. What was she going to do? She was confronted with the very truth that she just wanted to get on pass so she could develop some sort of general consensus. We are really living in a weird era, Will. CAIN: Yes. LOESCH: Just one quick note. We have a great -- we're in this great era of information and never before have people been wanting to dodge the truth so much, particularly the left. CAIN: There is no excuse for taxpayer dollars going to fund that. There's no need for NPR. LOESCH: Amen. CAIN: There is honestly no need for PBS. No matter how much we love ""Sesame Street,"" in the modern-day media economy... LOESCH: She can fund it herself. CAIN: ... there's no need to fund it. She can fund it herself. Hey, Dana, by the way... LOESCH: These people, if they believe in it so much, Will, they need to write the check. CAIN: You could beat me in a 1,600, I promise you. You could beat me in a 3,200, 1,600. You could beat me. (LAUGHTER) (CROSSTALK) LOESCH: Maybe like 15 years ago. I'm not sure now. (LAUGHTER) CAIN: No distance. No distance. All right, Dana Loesch, great to see you. Thank you. LOESCH: Thanks, Will. CAIN: All right. Ahead, the Signal chat leak, I have a few more thoughts before we say goodbye to this overhyped story about Signal. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAIN: It's almost time to say goodbye, to Signal chat gate. But before we move on, I have two lingering observations I'd love to share with you here today. For all the talk of war plans and classified documents, it's worth returning to the center of the story, the center of the matter. And at the center of the story is a person. It's Jeffrey Goldberg. My suspicion, is this will be the ongoing story as we move forward. If there's more to learn, it's how did Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic end up inside of a Signal chat group that included the biggest elected leaders of the United States of America? How did he end up hearing what he then ended up sharing in a headline that screamed, I got war plans two hours before they took place. It's one of the most overhyped and oversold stories of the last several years, but it still leaves open the question. What is the role of Jeffrey Goldberg? He literally is the center of the story. He got invited, apparently, perhaps, maybe. He got included in a private group deliberation. Now, if you or I get invited to a party, brought into a party that we really just weren't supposed to be at, we didn't get an invitation, we politely excuse ourselves. Maybe that makes light of the situation. Improper disclosures are always made in the legal world. Private filings, information you shouldn't receive is sometimes sent over e-mail to the wrong person. Lawyers bow out, announce their presence, and say it's time to move on. We saw none of that here with Jeffrey Goldberg. Instead, he sat around under the implausible rationale that he wanted to find out if it was real. He never bowed out. He never announced himself. Instead, the first the world heard of it is when he published what he claimed to be classified documents and overhyped and oversold as war plans. Is there not some ethical obligation Jeffrey Goldberg to announce himself and to leave? He literally is the story. But for his presence, it's not a story. It's not as though he uncovered Watergate. He overheard something through a wall that happened to matter of the national security. His presence is the story. What obligation does Jeffrey Goldberg have to make himself not the story and to leave what he knows then is one of a private and important deliberation among President Trump's top Cabinet? And that brings me to my second observation. I have had a long and ongoing debate with the secretary of defense about the use of emojis. I was very proud to see that Pete Hegseth did not respond with any fist-pumps or thumbs-ups in that group chat. And I like to say I'm at least very friendly with the national security adviser. So I did have some questions when I saw this in the group chat, punch, American flag, fire emoji, or Steve Witkoff, prayer hands, biceps, American flag. I just have a simple question, no criticism, an open question for you and everyone watching, and the Cabinet members. Emojis? Is that -- is that masculine? To help answer that question,let's go now to the ""Ruthless Podcast"" team, Josh Holmes, Comfortably Smug, Michael Duncan, and John Ashbrook. Fellows, you're the perfect guests. And I know that the national security adviser will not be upset. And it is one of open debate that I have had with secretary of defense. JOSH HOLMES, CO-HOST, ""RUTHLESS PODCAST"": Are you sure? Are you sure they won't be upset? (CROSSTALK) CAIN: No, but I'm willing to take that risk. COMFORTABLY SMUG, CO-HOST, ""RUTHLESS PODCAST"": I'm so thrilled that were brought in on this. CAIN: I'm willing to take that risk because this is of grave national import. Emojis? HOLMES: It is of grave national import. Let me just like shelve the emoji for one minute. This entire thing in your monologue was absolutely perfect. It is an indictment of the modern media, of everything that we're dealing with. Look, every administration makes a mistake on national security at some level or another. The previous administration, the Biden administration, the mistake that they made costs 13 lives of American Marines. The mistake that they made by adding a journalist to this conversation was in and of itself surrounded by a complete success of a mission that was 17 months in the making where a major thoroughfare of American commerce and everything else have been blocked down because of 175 separate attacks on U.S. Navy personnel. And President Trump decided to do something about that. CAIN: Yes. HOLMES: Somehow, we have lost that. Somehow, we have lost that part of the conversation where we're talking about a text chain. And the incredible success that we have had in this mission is not even noted by the media. CAIN: Right. I'm going to let the rest of you three, Smug, Duncan and Ashbrook, answer this as well. I won't put you on -- I know you're afraid that the NSA is going to come after you, but I'm sure you're going to be fine. Michael Waltz takes him -- does not take himself seriously. He takes his job seriously. I'm going to rest on that presumption, and he can take a good kidding. But let's stay on this topic for one more second. I have seen calls for resignation for many of these guys, but, yesterday, we went through this. There's no consistency on this. Obviously, there were no calls for resignation for Lloyd Austin when it came to Afghanistan. And I wish I would have brought this up yesterday, no calls when he went AWOL for four days. I mean, AWOL is sort of a big deal, Smug. COMFORTABLY SMUG: Yes. That's the thing is this entire story is a journalist inserting themselves into it, when it's actually the story, just like Holmes described, success, American troops -- or American service members carried out a flawless mission. And we should be happy that they did. But you have a journalist trying to make themselves the story. I would like to add that emojis can be masculine. (LAUGHTER) COMFORTABLY SMUG: None of the dudes -- so I think the folk probably are like, if you heart, if you're bro-texting, you like heart it, that's not OK. HOLMES: No. COMFORTABLY SMUG: If you give it like a thumbs-up, like an affirmative, that's cool. American flags, also cool. HOLMES: What about a GIF? A GIF? COMFORTABLY SMUG: I mean, I think that's over the top. HOLMES: Yes, too much? COMFORTABLY SMUG: But, like, American flags and explosions, especially when you're blowing up terrorists, I think totally warranted. MICHAEL DUNCAN, CO-HOST, ""RUTHLESS PODCAST"": Yes, and I think, like Gen X, you guys are cynical. You grew up on Nirvana. I'm a millennial. (LAUGHTER) DUNCAN: Yes, I'm a millennial. We live with our heart in our sleep. I am pro-emoji. You do you. CAIN: Good. Good. Pro-emoji. Ashbrook's a little closer to my age. Every time I send an emoji, every -- Ashbrook, every time I send an emoji -- I'm going to be honest with you and the audience. And I do it. I'm -- National Security Adviser, I don't live in a glass house, nor do I pretend perfection here. I do it from time to time, but every time I do, I question myself and feel a little more insecure. (LAUGHTER) JOHN ASHBROOK, CO-HOST, ""RUTHLESS PODCAST"": With good reason. With good reason, Will. I mean, I try to just parse out the emojis and I don't use them more than I should. HOLMES: What about a 100? Can we put a 100? That's pretty masculine. ASHBROOK: You can do a 100. But I think the larger point here is the one that you guys have already made, the one that Will was getting at in his monologue, in that -- and it's basically that the previous administration under Joe Biden, what did they do about the Houthi terrorists? They removed them from the terrorist list. What did this current administration with President Trump and Pete Hegseth do? They killed the terrorists. And that's exactly what people voted for. (CROSSTALK) CAIN: Fellows, I'm off tomorrow, so you have a head start. You have four days, so I'm going to make a humble suggestion to you for the next episode of the ""Ruthless"" program. Otherwise, it's going to show up on ""The Will Cain Show."" An approved list of emojis, OK? Masculine emojis, those that are approved and those that are disapproved. Maybe Waltz and Witkoff were all on the up and up. There was no, I don't know which -- I don't know yet. I don't know what's unapproved, but we're going to find it on the next episode of the ""Ruthless"" program. (CROSSTALK) HOLMES: We're going to go super deep on this, Will. We will not let you down. CAIN: No. All right, it's the kind of hard-hitting content I expect. Thank you, fellows. (LAUGHTER) CAIN: All right, it's Major League Baseball opening day, and we're kicking off the 2025 season with the two-time Yankees World Series champion. There he is. He's a Longhorn. Hopefully, gives me a Hook 'em Horns the way out. We're going to bring in Roger Clemens. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAIN: It's opening day, MLB season kicking off with a slew of games, including my Texas Rangers. And my next guest has eight opening day starts in his 24-year career. I would say among his accomplishments, that's ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 Roger, we're watching it on our screen right now. This is you at home plate meeting your son there to exchange lineup cards. He with the Phillies, you as an instructor with the Yankees. That's a cool moment, Roger. Had to be really special. ROGER CLEMENS, FORMER MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL PLAYER: Will, thanks, brother. I appreciate it. Yes, that was -- I think it's the first time it's ever happened. AT least, a couple of the umpires thought it was history. I'm glad I didn't park in any of the umpires' parking spots before the game, so they took it easy on the kid there. But that was a fun moment. CAIN: Yes. CLEMENS: The Yankees and Phillies got together and planned it. It was fun. CAIN: Yes, I mean, father, son, I mean, that's what it's -- I don't know. That's kind of what it's all about. Let's talk about -- let's talk about the season, Roger. What do you think? I mean, the easy pick, the easy -- and I'm not saying if you go this way that you're taking the layup, but it's the Dodgers again. And maybe we're on the verge of another dynasty, the first since the Yankees in the late '90s. CLEMENS: You're right, brother. But, first, let me just tell you that, during the commercial break, I had to go into my phone and start getting rid of all these emojis, I guess. So you guys made me nervous. (LAUGHTER) (CROSSTALK) CAIN: Wait, wait, wait. Is the Rocket an emoji user? Be honest. If I text you, am I getting emojis back? CLEMENS: You're going to get a check mark, so I don't have to give you a long answer. And you might get, like you said, the Hook 'em Horns. They do have a Hook 'em Horns on there. CAIN: Any day. CLEMENS: So you might get that one. CAIN: I will take that from you any day. CLEMENS: But, no, you're right. The Dodgers are -- the Dodgers are still the team right now. They're loaded. The Phillies, which my youngest one is with, we talked about, and the Yankees, they're built to win now. And they really need to try and win now is what -- is the mode. But like they said, spring is a lot of hope for all the teams right now. And -- but I'm glad the season is under way. It's an exciting time of year. I'm going to bounce into Philly and watch opening day there, those guys. You're Ranger guys. You're a Ranger, Texas Ranger guy, which I like watching those guys too here in our home state; deGrom is back. CAIN: Yes. CLEMENS: So -- and I like Eovaldi. So pitching is like -- I always said, Will, pitching is like buying a house or property, location, location, location. CAIN: Yes. CLEMENS: Why -- while all these guys are chasing velocity so much, they're always trying to get the radar gun to reach triple digits, it's still about being a power pitcher and locating. CAIN: All right, Roger, I have got like half-a-minute, I mean, a minute- and-a-half, 90 seconds with you here. And I'm going to ask you one controversial question. I'm going to put you - - so I thought about asking about Mookie Betts and visiting President Trump at the White House. No, no, no. What I have learned is you're a big JFK buff, big history guy, big JFK assassination buff. You -- have you made your way through the 80,000 released documents? Do you have your theory? CLEMENS: I haven't. And I have plenty of theories, but I haven't, but I'm looking forward to doing that. My wife and mom were up the road a little bit when all that went down. She was obviously a young baby at the time, but I was fortunate, Will, to play in two of the most storied cities, ballparks with Fenway Park and old Yankee Stadium. In Boston, Deb and Caroline have made -- become friends, so I was able to meet a few of the Kennedys. We know the Bushes here. Your topic on the White House, it's an honor to go to the White House. It doesn't matter who the president is. There's some presidents that I didn't vote for became our president, but I rooted for our president to do well, no matter what, once he's in there. And the same thing goes with President Trump. It still amazes me that, what, seven months ago, he almost got shot on national TV. They let a guy into the rally, Will, as you know. I know I'm rehashing things, but it's still amazing to me they let a guy into a rally with a range finder of all things. It's bizarre. CAIN: Right. CLEMENS: I mean, come on now. I'm pretty sure, with President Trump in the White House, you're not going to see a spy balloon fly across the country. So -- but, man, it's crazy. But, again, just rooting for the guy. (CROSSTALK) CAIN: I gave him 90 seconds and said, I'm only going to ask you one controversial question. He hit four controversial topics in that time, from a spy balloon, an assassination attempt, visiting the White House, and the JFK assassination. That is impressive work. CLEMENS: Let's go. CAIN: Look at it right there. He still throws heat. CLEMENS: Good seeing you. CAIN: Roger Clemens, You're welcome, by the way. I'm a few steps from Dealey Plaza. We can take a walk through history together or see each other in Austin for a Longhorn baseball game. CLEMENS: Let's do it. I would love that. I would love that. CAIN: All right, thank you, Roger. CLEMENS: All right, buddy," thanks. CAIN: Take care. It's time for """"Will of the People."""" One user asks: """"Hey", Will," how sad are you to not be watching the Rangers opening day baseball? Baseball is back."""" I am sad"," and I have got 161 more games to make up for it. Another says: """"Hey"," we over 50 love emojis."""" Do you think it's an over 50 thing or is it a young kid thing?

Interview with Theodis Daniel Jr. and D.J. Daniel,2025-03-05T00:00:00Z,Steve Doocy,"FOX AND FRIENDS 6:00 AM EST Theodis Daniel Jr., D.J. Daniel Fox News, FOX AND FRIENDS6:00 AM EST, NEWS; International, 452words",U.S. Federal; Texas,"STEVE DOOCY, FOX NEWS HOST: Joining us right now on the heels of this very exciting night, that 13-year-old cancer survivor, D.J. Daniel, and his dad, Theodis. Good morning to both of you. THEODIS DANIEL JR., FATHER OF 13-YEAR-OLD CANCER SURVIVOR: Certainly. Good morning, sir. DOOCY: So, D.J., you're up in the gallery. The president is talking about you. And then you heard what he said and your eyes got wider. What were you thinking? D.J. DANIEL, CANCER SURVIVOR: I was not expecting it. Nobody even told us, even though that they knew they didn't even want to tell us. DOOCY: Well -- so how did they, what did they tell you about going to this event last night, this joint session, to get you there? D. DANIEL: Well, really and truly, I wasn't expecting it to be like that, to be honest. DOOCY: Yes, well, it was something. And there you were with all the most powerful people in the world. You've got -- I know Elon Musk was there and everything else. Dad, let's talk to you a little bit about this. I know ever since your son was diagnosed with brain cancer, as he's gone through his treatment and his surgeries, he has made it a quest to try to be sworn in as an honorary member of law enforcement as to as many agencies as possible. How is that going? T. DANIEL: Well, I miss dad, but I realized I became a chauffeur. So, I found him driving all across the nation and relentless and tireless to get him there, and because the Texas Children's is considering his swearing as a treatment, so we utilize that. His brothers are actually his medical support too. DOOCY: Right. T. DANIEL: Yes, sir. DOOCY: And so he's been sworn in by 909 different agencies. But D.J., last night, you officially became a member of the Secret Service. That's the coolest one, right? D. DANIEL: Yes, sir. Yes. DOOCY: You know, I know you were on -- you did talk to the first lady. You have not spoken to the president directly. He, I think, is watching right now. What would you like to say to Donald Trump? D. DANIEL: I'd like to say thank you to him. And I hope he got his cowboy hat because I bought him a brown one from Texas, but I'm not sure if they got it out the thing that where they check it because the dog had to sniff it and stuff like that. DOOCY: I got a feeling after you just said that, they're going to make sure that he gets it. And, listen, the whole world watched you last night and we're praying for you during your treatment and we were all crying. Were you crying D.J. or dad? D. DANIEL: Not at all? DOOCY: Not at all? Holy cow. It was really something. Guys, thank you very much for joining us on Fox and Friends and have a safe trip back to Houston. T. DANIEL: Thank you. D. DANIEL: Yes, sir. DOOCY: Congratulations, D.J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And I'm not going to go, because we've got a few seconds. So, I have a wonderful weekend. That's it for us. AISHAH HASNIE, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening and Happy Friday to you. Welcome to Washington. I'm Aishah Hasnie, in for Bret Baier tonight. President Trump rescinds hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grants to an Ivy League University. We're going to tell you why that happened. A man accused of attempting to assassinate President Trump last year appears in Court. And new information tonight about what caused the deaths of Gene Hackman and his wife. But first, ""BREAKING TONIGHT,"" President Trump says he believes Russian leader Vladimir Putin wants peace, and that it may be easier dealing with him than Ukraine. The president had several appearances today commenting on issues both foreign such as Ukraine and Iran, and domestic, as in tariffs and crypto currency. Senior White House correspondent, Peter Doocy, kicking things off tonight live from the North Lawn. Good evening to you, Peter. PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Aishah, good evening. We just watched President Trump lift off for the winter White House in Palm Beach, after another day making the argument about trade policy that he believes some economic disturbances are going to be worth it if the United States eventually gets to a more fair place with our trading partners. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DOOCY (voice over): After a week of tinkering with tariffs -- DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: There will always be changes and adjustments. DOOCY (voice over): Some conservative economists are pleading with the president for a redirect. STEVE MOORE, FORMER TRUMP ECONOMIC ADVISER: What I am very much in favor of is going after our enemy. And then, you know, Canada, Mexico are not our enemy, China is. So, let's get really tough with China. DOOCY (voice over): But the president is finding an unlikely ally in the head of a major labor union, referring to a Tuesday statement, he writes, ""The head of the United Auto Workers of America just stated that tariffs are necessary to correct years of abuse of the USA by other countries and companies. We have lost 90,000 factories and plants since the beginning of NAFTA. He is 100 percent correct."" TRUMP: You have a Fender made in Canada. You have something else made in Mexico. We don't want that. We want it made here. DOOCY (voice over): The president is also trying something new in Ukraine. SEN. TOM COTTON (R-AR): We're going to find out if Vladimir Putin is serious about having an end to the fighting. DOOCY (voice over): President Trump warns Moscow, based on the fact that Russia is absolutely pounding Ukraine on the battlefield right now, I'm strongly considering large scale banking sanctions, sanctions, and tariffs on Russia. MICHAEL WALTZ, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: The Russians are taking incredible losses on the front. As the president has said, this is a meat grinder of people -- DOOCY (voice over): With eyes on the future of the financial industry, the president hosted a first of its kind, White House crypto summit. TRUMP: We feel like pioneers, in a way, tremendous method of growth. DOOCY (voice over): But the president's favorite event of the day appeared to be the ceremonial start of the USA's turn to host next year's World Cup. TRUMP: Like three Super Bowls a day for a month. That's what it is. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's what it is. (END VIDEOTAPE) DOOCY (on camera): And this weekend is the deadline. President Trump has given his spy chiefs to deliver him their plans for the eventual release of classified documents relating to the RFK and MLK assassinations. He's had the plan from the intel community for the release of the JFK documents since last month, but we still don't know when exactly we get to see those. Aishah? HASNIE: A lot of people waiting for those. Peter Doocy, live for us on this Friday evening. Thank you, Peter. And ""BREAKING TONIGHT"", President Trump is hitting an Ivy League school with an enormous penalty for failing to deal with antisemitism on campus. Correspondent Alexis McAdams is in New York tonight, telling us who is getting hit and by how much? Good evening, Alexis. ALEXIS MCADAMS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Aishah, good evening. Well, President Trump had warned schools and universities to stop these illegal protests or get their funding cut. Now, Columbia University becoming the first to lose $400 million in federal funding and counting. We reached out to the university, who responded, saying, in part, ""We are reviewing the announcement from the federal agencies and pledged to work with the federal government to restore Columbia's federal funding."" So, we'll see what happens. This comes after students here at Columbia tell us the pamphlets are being handed out on campus like this. They are claiming to be from the Hamas media office, which, for people out there, was very shocking, calling the October 7th attack by Hamas a moral victory. Passing around photos of known leaders of terror groups as the DOJ's Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism says criminal charges could soon be coming here. Also, ICE deporting a student who it claims was in the country illegally, telling Fox News, he was arrested on criminal charges at a protest in connection with supporting Hamas. So, now, his visa is going to be taken away. Axios is reporting that the Secretary of State Marco Rubio is planning to use artificial intelligence to identify and investigate foreign exchange students for taking and supporting Hamas or terror groups. Then, they'll seek to have their visas revoked too. So, a lot happening on these protests, and we watch them happen for months. As of last year, listen to this. Columbia University reported having a more than $14 billion endowment at the school. Now, the Ivy League receives more than $5 billion in funding from the federal government. The DOJ Task Force says the cuts are just beginning. Aishah. HASNIE: Alexis McAdams, great job covering the story. Thank you. Tonight, there appear to be some subtle shifts in the job descriptions for Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency. President Trump now says Musk's group cannot make final decisions on mass firings. There are also some not-so subtle adjustments in the way authorities are handling certain law enforcement situations. Correspondent Mark Meredith shows us tonight. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Get your hands off her. MARK MEREDITH, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): It's the latest sign of a changing Washington. Today, D.C. police clearing out dozens of homeless encampments, as President Trump vows to reshape the city inside and out. KEVIN HASSETT, DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE ECONOMIC COUNCIL: We saw a reduction in federal employment of about 10,000 workers. MEREDITH (voice over): Tonight, the White House is celebrating the latest jobs report, showing the federal workforce is shrinking. Republican leaders cheering on the cuts. REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): The government is too big, it does too many things, and it does almost nothing well. MEREDITH (voice over): But The New York Times reports, inside Trump's Cabinet, there is growing tension with Elon Musk and his DOGE team. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, reportedly among those most furious over Musk's firing spree. The Times says the two men yelled at each other in front of the president. Today, Trump denied any tension. TRUMP: No clash. I was there. Elon gets along great with Marco. MEREDITH (voice over): Still, DOGE continues to kill government contracts. The group posting it found a V.A. contractor being paid $56,000 to water eight plants. DOGE says it will ""water the plants free of charge."" But lawmakers from both parties are concerned about major layoffs planned at the Veterans Affairs Department. SEN. TIM KAINE (D-VA): This is a war on veterans, and they can't claim it's accidental. MEREDITH (voice over): Michigan Republican Congressman Tom Barrett wants V.A. Secretary Doug Collins to reconsider laying off 15 percent of his workforce. Barrett writing, ""Any veteran who hangs up their boots and continues to serve their country at the V.A. is cut from a different cloth."" Collins says the cuts, while painful, are necessary. DOUG COLLINS, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS: Look, the V.A. was never perfect, and it will never be perfect, but we can and will make it better. (END VIDEOTAPE) MEREDITH (on camera): Today, a federal judge rejected an emergency request by two labor unions to block Musk's team from accessing a payment system at the treasury department. But last month, a judge also blocked similar access to a program. So, this is all likely an issue, Aishah, that could end up before the Supreme Court before long. HASNIE: We will see. Mark Meredith, thank you. Have a good weekend. Well, the U.S. employers added 151,000 jobs last month. The Labor Department reports the hiring was up from a revised 125,000 in January. The unemployment rate rose slightly to 4.1 percent Stocks were up today. The Dow gained 223. The S&P 500 finished ahead 32. NASDAQ up 127. For the week, the Dow lost 2-1/3 percentage points. The S&P was down three. NASDAQ down a 3-1/2. The man charged with a second attempt on President Trump's life last year, made an appearance in a federal court today. This comes as the president says he hopes to have updates on the investigations into both attempts by next week Correspondent David Spunt has details tonight from the Justice Department. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Keep walking! DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The man accused of plotting to kill then-former President Trump in federal custody today. 59-year-old Ryan Routh sat handcuffed as he listened to government attorneys and his public defender fight over access to evidence. His team wants more. But the DOJ claims, they already have it. His attorneys will not mount an insanity defense, and the trial is set to begin in September. Authorities say Routh was in the bushes of Trump's West Palm Beach Golf Club for almost 12 hours last September. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Driver! SPUNT (voice over): A secret service agent spotted the barrel of a gun, and Routh was later arrested on the side of the road. Authorities eventually found 17 cell phones and a handwritten letter. Routh allegedly wrote, ""Dear World, this was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump, but I am so sorry I failed you."" Routh previously visited Ukraine to protest against the Russian invasion in 2022. JONATHAN TURLEY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: This guy seems to have a sort of global identity and awareness to him that is always going to concern American intelligence. SPUNT (voice over): Yesterday, the president said he hopes a report he'll see next week will provide answers. TRUMP: Want to release the report. I've been -- maybe there's a reason that we shouldn't -- so, I don't want to get too far ahead of my skis. SPUNT (voice over): The FBI is leading the investigation, though it's unclear if the report will focus on Routh and or Thomas Crooks, the man who shot Trump and killed one other person at a Pennsylvania rally last July. Crooks was killed at the scene by a secret service sniper. Authorities have yet to find a motive in that case. (END VIDEOTAPE) SPUNT (on camera): Authorities believe, both men acted alone separately. President Trump may find out, he'll get more information with allies at the top of the FBI, Director Kash Patel, leading the FBI, and Secret Service Director Sean Curran, perhaps, making the information flow better to the White House from those agencies. Aishah? HASNIE: David, one more quick thing before you go. Tonight, we are learning that the Homeland Security Secretary wants the Justice Department to investigate those folks that leaked the raids targeting illegal aliens. What can you tell us about that? SPUNT: Well, that's exactly right. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, posted a video earlier, first obtained by Fox News, announcing that two department of homeland security employees are responsible and have been identified for leaking information about ICE ops to the media. Previously, she insisted that the FBI was involved somehow. Now, she is saying it's coming from inside DHS. The FBI has denied this from the beginning. Aishah? HASNIE: OK. We'll see where that goes. David Spunt, live for us tonight. Thank you, David. SPUNT: Thank you. HASNIE: Up next, an update on the investigation into the deaths of actor Gene Hackman and his wife. First, here is what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. FOX29 in Philadelphia, there, as investigators probe the deadly crash of a medical plane in Philly in back in January. They released their preliminary report, and it's believed now the plane struck a commercial sign during its dissent. Seven people were killed and two dozens injured. The National Transportation Safety Board says the cockpit voice recorder did not capture the flight's final moments. It says the device likely had not been recording audio for several years. FOX11 in Los Angeles, there, as the state department offers a $10 million reward now for information leading to the arrest of a former Olympic snowboarder wanted for running a multinational drug trafficking network. Authorities there say Canadian athlete, Ryan Wedding orchestrated multiple murders related to the drug ring. And take a look at this. A live look at St. Petersburg, Florida from FOX13, one of our big stories there tonight. St. Petersburg-based space startup Lonestar Data Holdings, says its lunar data center is the only surviving payload after that private lunar lander came down sideways on the moon. That happened yesterday. The lander missed its mark by more than 800 feet, wound up in a frigid crater. That's tonight's live look, ""OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY"" from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) AISHAH HASNIE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The Homeland Security Department says it is ending the collective bargaining agreement with Transportation Security Administration frontline workers. DHS claims poor performers are allowed to stay on the job, and that makes it harder to keep transportation safe. The TSA has about 50,000 officers. The top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee, Betty Thompson, says this move makes zero sense and it will reduce morale. Breaking tonight, we've got new information right now about the investigation into the deaths of actor Gene Hackman and his wife. Senior correspondent Alicia Acuna has the latest tonight from Denver. Good evening to you, Alicia. ALICIA ACUNA, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Aishah. The chief medical examiner for the state of New Mexico says it's reasonable to conclude that Betsy Arakawa, also known as Betsy Hackman, died seven days before her husband, actor Gene Hackman. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. HEATHER JARRELL, NEW MEXICO CHIEF MEDICAL EXAMINER: The cause of death for Miss Betsy Hackman, age 65 years, is Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. The manner of death is natural. ACUNA (voice over): Hantavirus is a rare respiratory disease with flu like symptoms that is passed from rodents to humans. JARRELL: The cause of death for Mr. Gene Hackman, age 95 years, is hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with Alzheimer's disease as a significant contributory factor. ACUNA (voice over): The Santa Fe county sheriff says February 11th is the last day Mrs. Hackman was known to be alive. Records show she sent e-mails that morning before surveillance video shows she ran errands in town. A time stamp shows she re-entered the gated community where the couple lived after 5:00 in the evening, that is when cell phone and e-mail activity for her stopped. As for the two time Oscar winning actor, the chief medical examiner explained Hackman likely died around February 18th, a day after his pacemaker stopped recording activity. Dr. Heather Jarrell said she is not aware of what Hackman's normal daily functioning capability was. And at 95 was in a, ""very poor state of health."" JARRELL: He was in an advanced state of Alzheimer's, and it's quite possible that he was not aware that she was deceased. (END VIDEOTAPE) ACUNA (on camera): A maintenance worker discovered the bodies of the couple and that of one of their dogs on February 26th, eight days after Mr. Hackman is believed to have died, and 15 days after his wife passed, Aishah. HASNIE: Alicia, thank you. President Trump is now reaching out to Iran. He's seeking a new agreement to restrain the Islamic Republic's rapidly advancing nuclear program. He says we are now down to the final moments, and that the U.S. cannot allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon. Senior National Correspondent Rich Edson has the latest tonight for us. Good evening to you, Rich. RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Aishah. Well, the president who last tore up the final nuclear agreement with Iran says he is interested in a new deal. President Trump told Fox's Maria Bartiromo that he sent a letter yesterday to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini. Trump says he is ready to talk about Iran's nuclear program. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I hope you're going to negotiate, because it's going to be a lot better for Iran, and I think they want to get that letter. The other alternative is we have to do something, because you can't let them have a nuclear weapon. EDSON (voice over): A United Nations report last week found Iran has accelerated production of near weapons grade uranium. In his Oval Office this afternoon, Trump stressed his administration needs to address that. TRUMP: We're down to final strokes with Iran. That's going to be an interesting time, and we'll see what happens. But we're down to the final moments. EDSON (voice over): In 2018, the Trump administration withdrew from the Obama era nuclear deal and hit Iran with severe sanctions, a policy it called maximum pressure. Last week, the State Department announced maximum pressure on Iran is back. And ""As long as Iran devotes its energy revenues to financing attacks on our allies, supporting terrorism around the world, or pursuing other destabilizing actions, we will use all the tools at our disposal."" Iran's foreign minister told AFP, ""We will not enter any direct negotiations with the U.S., so long as they continue their maximum pressure policy and their threats. But it doesn't mean that regarding our nuclear program, we will not negotiate with other parties."" The Biden administration unsuccessfully held indirect nuclear negotiations through other countries. American, European allies, China and Russia, Aishah. HASNIE: Rich, thank you. And you can watch Maria Bartiromo's full exclusive interview with President Trump Sunday at 10:00 a.m. Eastern on ""SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES"" right here on Fox News. Two active duty Army soldiers and one former soldier have now been arrested in Oregon for their alleged roles in gathering and sending sensitive information to individuals in China. The Justice Department says the two active duty personnel were stationed at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, all three men were charged with conspiring to commit bribery and theft of government property. Up next, we get a close look at text messages between the two survivors of the Idaho student massacre. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HASNIE: Welcome back. Tonight, we are getting our first look at chilling text messages exchanged between the two survivors of the 2022 Idaho student massacre. This comes as attorneys for suspect Bryan Kohberger try to get the death penalty off the table. Correspondent Dan Springer reports tonight from Seattle. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAN SPRINGER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): This rental just off the University of Idaho campus was a house of horror, five roommates and a boyfriend of one asleep at 4:00 a.m. Only two of the six would survive. One, Dylan Mortensen came face to face with the killer, the third time she looked out her bedroom door after hearing noises. Frightened, she went back into her room, and, according to court documents, tried to contact her roommates. Only Bethany Funk responded. No one is answering. I'm really confused. Then she tried another roommate, Kaylee, what's going on? Flustered Bethany writes, ""Xana wearing all black?"" Dylan replies, ""No. It's like a ski mask almost, like he had something over his head and mouth."" They both say they were freaking out, then Bethany texts, ""Come to my room. Run."" Nearly eight hours later at noon, finally a 911 call from a group inside the house. One of the roommates, ""She's not waking up. Oh, and they saw some man in their house last night."" Prosecutors say that man was Bryan Kohberger, at the time a criminology grad student at nearby Washington State University. He's charged with using a large knife to murder Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Xana Kernodle, and her boyfriend, Ethan Chapin. Prosecutors want to use the text messages at trial to help establish a timeline. In other motions, it was learned Mogen apparently fought her attacker. A DNA mixture was found under her fingernails, but tests on whose DNA were inconclusive. Also, the defense is asking that the death penalty be taken off the table because of claims Kohberger has autism. (END VIDEO TAPE) SPRINGER: The trial judge Steven Hippler has already ruled on a number of death penalty motions and declared Kohberger is eligible to be executed if found go ahead. His trial is set to begin August 11th. Aishah? HASNIE: Dan Springer for us, thank you. We are learning tonight about how criminals in Mexico get their hands on weapons. FOX News has obtained U.S. government documents pointing the finger at one entity in particular. National correspondent William La Jeunesse tells us what that is from Los Angeles. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: As the U.S. pressures Mexico to stop the flow of fentanyl, Mexico wants the U.S. to stop the flow of guns. STEVE SHADOWEN, MEXICAN GOVERNMENT CO-LEAD COUNSEL: The guns flow south. But that enables the drugs to flow north. LA JEUNESSE: Mexico blames the U.S. for failing to stop the so-called iron river of guns, legally sold in the U.S. at gun stores then illegally smuggled to Mexican cartels. PABLO ARROCHA, MEXICAN FOREIGN MINISTRY: To stop the cartels, you must cut off their supply of firearms. LA JEUNESSE: One of the surprising sources, according to internal ATF documents, is the government of Mexico itself. Some 4,000 guns found at Mexican crime scenes over the last decade were actually purchased by the Mexican government for its military and police. Another source, U.S. military surplus guns also acquired by the Mexican government. JOHN DODSON, RETIRED ATF SENIOR SPECIAL AGENT: These firearms have been purchased by them and somehow diverted into the black market, used in crimes by the cartel, traced by law enforcement, but because it's stamped us or imported into the U.S., it is considered a U.S.-sourced firearm. And that is not fair to the American firearms industry. LA JEUNESSE: That's not to say the U.S. doesn't have a problem. ATF data shows hundreds of guns purchased legally in the U.S. are smuggled and sold to the cartels, fueling a cycle of violence both sides have failed to stop. (END VIDEO TAPE) LA JEUNESSE (on camera): The solution? Well, longtime ATF agents say Mexico should begin inspecting southbound traffic for guns at their ports of entry. Secondly, the U.S. could begin charging citizen smugglers with providing material support to terrorist organizations. Ten to 20 years in a federal prison could act as a strong deterrent for those making $300 on the black market reselling assault rifles. Aishah? HASNIE: William La Jeunesse reporting for us in Los Angeles. Thank you, William. An organization devoted to press freedom and responsible journalism is honoring one of our colleagues. Last night, FOX News chief foreign affairs correspondent Trey Yingst received the RTDNA Foundation's First Amendment award. The organization noted that Trey does remarkable work brings us the stories of those caught in the warzones all around the world. He has reported extensively and tirelessly from locations like Ukraine, the Middle East, Afghanistan, and so much more. We join all of those congratulating Trey and his team. We are so immensely proud of him. Up next, Elon Musk wants to privatize the Postal Service and Amtrak. Plus, Bret Baier on how artificial intelligence is now finding new ways to help kids diagnosed with heart disease. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HASNIE: What do you think about this? Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency, DOGE, want to privatize the U.S. Postal Service and Amtrak. Tonight, correspondent Alexandra Hoff takes a look at how all of that might work. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) ALEXANDRIA HOFF, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: At a tech conference this week, Elon Musk called the state of American rail travel embarrassing, naming Amtrak and the U.S. Postal Service as services he would like to see privatized. Amtrak immediately fired back, arguing ""A private entity would face the same constraints as Amtrak, but it would lack Amtrak's essential statutory right to operate over the national rail network."" Amtrak has battled privatization calls for decades, telling FOX it's now on track to reach operational profitability for the first time in history. Last year Amtrak reported a $705 million adjusted operating loss, a nine percent improvement from 2023. JOE BIDEN, (D) FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I commuted every day 212 miles a day every day on Amtrak, so I like trains. HOFF: Former President Biden directed billions to Amtrak, which relies heavily on federal subsidies. The U.S. Postal Service, on the other hand, is primarily self-funded by fees. Its budget is complicated by employee retirement costs which, unlike most federal agencies, comes out of USPS revenue. USPS reported a $9.5 billion net loss last year. During President Trump's first term, he commissioned a task force to explore privatizing the Postal Service. Just before taking office again, he maintained it's -- DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: Not the worst idea I have ever heard. HOFF: But the president is now interested in a new idea, combining the Postal Service and Commerce Department. TRUMP: We are thinking about doing that, and it will be a form of a merger. But it will remain the Postal Service. And I think it will operate a lot better than it has been over the years. (END VIDEO TAPE) HOFF (on camera): Bipartisan legislation has been reintroduced to help the Postal Service with how its retiree benefits impact its budget. Major changes to USPS or Amtrak would require congressional approval, Aishah. HASNIE: As if Congress needs one more thing to think about. But they do have a lot to handle and juggle, which they need to do. Alex Hoff, thank you. In the United States every 15 minute as child is born with a heart defect. Australia's Murdoch Children's Research Institute, a worldwide leader in pediatric research, is now working to find new ways to help kids diagnosed with heart disease. Dame Elizabeth Murdoch, the mother of FOX News founder Rupert Murdoch, was a founds member of MCRI. And tonight, Bret Baier takes a look at how artificial intelligence is playing a key role. BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Thanks, Aishah. The Murdoch Children's Research Institute is partnering with the Gladstone Institute in San Francisco. The Decoding Broken Hearts program is helping scientists develop precision therapies using stem cell medicine and artificial intelligence. Tonight, we take a closer look at the collaboration. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) DAVID ELLIOTT, MURDOCH CHILDREN'S RESEARCH INSTITUTE: We are really interested in understanding how kids develop heart disease and where we interfere to stop it progressing. BAIER: Heart disease is the leading cause of death and disability in children and impacts one in every 100 births. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I need a little bit more. BAIER: Amelia and Elijah are siblings from Melbourne living with the same genetic heart condition. EBONY MALLINSON, MOTHER: She woke up one morning, it was a Sunday, and we took her to our local emergency because she had woken up. She was swollen. We thought she was just sleepy, but it turns out she was in and out of consciousness. BAIER: Amelia was two-years-old which doctors discovered her heart disease. MALLINSON: After they had done her chest x-ray, they realized that her heart was a lot larger than it should have been, and they realized she was in heart failure. BAIER: Amelia waited nearly one year for a transplant, and after a successful treatment, lives a mostly normal life. MALLINSON: She has really not had any issues posttransplant at all in relation to her heart. BAIER: The same goes for Elijah who was diagnosed with the same heart condition a few years later but has not need a transplant. MALLINSON: It was quite a shock because we weren't aware of what would cause him to have a heart condition. ELLIOTT: What we're trying to do in collaboration with the Gladstone Institute in the USA is to try and look at ways that we can stop proceeding to transplant and try and rescue the disease, or even stop it going further. BAIER: David Elliott leads the heart disease group at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute. He is helping to find treatments for heart defects before kids show signs of disease. ELLIOTT: For many the disease would be absolutely critical. If you could correct the problem in utero those who have very severe heart disease when they have three surgeries before they are five and it's very draining for the families involved. And so what we would really like to do is really progress that and allow those children a much more effective life. BAIER: The institute is part of the Royal Children's Hospital which treats around 700 heart conditions each year. Every single case is enrolled in the Decoding Broken Hearts program. ELLIOTT: We can use a special technology called reprogramming, so we take a small sample of this child's blood. From that we can create a heart cell, and exact replica up here in the laboratory of the child's heart cell. BAIER: Researchers then create additional small heart replicas to alter the function and find possible treatments for the patients. ELLIOTT: We're trying to use all of those different tools and technologies to understand how the disease develops and where we can look for new therapies using proceeding medicine to help kids with heart disease. BAIER: One of the newest tools with the help of the Gladstone Institutes is artificial intelligence. ELLIOTT: What A.I. allows us to do is millions and millions of experiments in the computer before we bring them into the cell. And that really allows us to target in and look at the ideal spot to interfere to help cure a disease. BAIER: Amelia and Elijah also participated in studies to further advance treatments for conditions like theirs. MALLINSON: If it even helps one family, it's worth it. Every staff member that you come in contact with at the hospital and doing research, they all make a huge difference in the lives of the kids and everyone in the families of these kids.

But right now, they are bombing the hell out of Ukraine and Ukraine -- I'm finding it more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine. And they don't have the cards. In terms of getting a final settlement, it may be easier dealing with Russia, which is surprising, because they have all the cards. (END VIDEO CLIP) HASNIE: More news from the Oval Office today.

" and Annie Linskey White House reporter for """"The Wall Street Journal"""". Good evening to all of you", happy Friday. Let's get this show on the road. So let's start with what is happening abroad and President Trump's comments in the Oval Office today. Hugh, I'll come to you," first. He's considering these sanctions on banking and Russia. Let's pull up the Truth Social that he put out today. He said that """"Based on the fact that Russia is absolutely pounding Ukraine on the battlefield right now", I'm strongly considering large scale banking sanctions," sanctions and tariffs on Russia until a cease-fire and final settlement agreement on peace is reached."""" So", we have seen sanctions before. President Biden tried this to try to avert the war it on Ukraine, to try to stop the war on Ukraine. It didn't work. How might this be different? HUGH HEWITT, SYNDICATED RADIO HOST: Putin knows that President Trump is very, very serious. Trump ordered the execution, basically, of 200 Wagner expeditionary forces that came at Americans in Syria. He ordered the cutoff of the LNG. He knows, Putin knows that when Trump threatens him it's a real threat backed up by a real tough man. So I don't know that President Zelenskyy quite knows that yet, but getting them both to understand that is, I think, a very important thing. I they he's getting it done. HASNIE: Annie, we have got this big meeting happening next week where Ukraine officials will meet with White House officials in Saudi Arabia. What needs to happen? ANNIE LINSKEY," """"WALL STREET JOURNAL"""": That meeting was referenced today. I was in the Oval Office with the president when he made those remarks. And he brought up his national security adviser who sort of was put on the spot to talk about that very meeting. And he said that things are looking like they are on track. So some of the public noise", I think, he was signaling that there's some smoothness behind the scenes, and his take was that things are kind, as he said, back on track, going on track. HASNIE: OK, we'll see. Matt, obviously Iran also came up, and the president made somewhat of an ominous threat here. Let's listen to it together. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: We're down to final strokes with Iran. That's going to be an interesting time. And we'll see what happens. But we are down to the final moments. We're at final moments, can't let them have a nuclear weapon. I'm not speaking out of strength or weakness. I'm just saying I would rather see a peace deal than the other. But the other will solve the problem. (END VIDEO CLIP) HASNIE: We are in the final moments. What did you make of that? Some of these similar threats, Hugh was nodding his head, were directed at Hamas too. And now he is not so happy with the way that things are going. MATT BENNETT, THIRD WAY CO-FOUNDER: Right. One never knows with President Trump. He kind of makes threats. He walks up the line, he walks back. We have seen that on the tariffs a bunch of times. He threatened Greenland in the speech the other night before Congress and said, you know, we're going to get it one way or the other. He has threatened our allies. He has threatened Ukraine. He threatens a lot of countries. It isn't clear to me at all what he means. Is it going to be military action? Is it going to be something else? Look, we all need to hope that he can pressure Iran to back off of their nuclear program. But the efforts that he made in the first term with North Korea really didn't work. He tried his letters of love with the president of North Korea and that didn't work. I'm a little skeptical about this one. HASNIE: OK, we'll see what Iran does, if they are threatened at all by what he said today. Hugh, you want to add to that, because you were kind of nodding -- HEWITT: I want to add a B-52 and an Israeli F-35 and an Israeli F-15 did a training mission this week together. That's about as signally as signal as it can get. HASNIE: Yes, OK, let's turn back -- yes, go ahead. LINSKEY: The only thing I would say here is we are talking about Iran giving up nuclear weapons or stopping their pursuit of nuclear weapons. One thing you can look at is history. Ukraine gave up nuclear weapons. And right now, they're under attack. And so I think this is a reason that if you do not want the Iranians to pursue nuclear weapons, you need to able to keep promises, and these countries need to feel like they will be secure without them. HASNIE: Annie, I'll come back to you for tariffs as we heard towards domestic policy. I think that's what the name of the game was this week. Everybody talked about tariffs, nobody wanted to talk about tariffs. So this job report came out today. We saw DOGE's effects. Unemployment is up to four percent now. The president said he's OK with that because he is hoping that his tariffs will bring in better jobs. What do you make of what he said today? LINSKEY: Well, the issue with tariffs, the president was going to, as you pointed out, he was going to enact tough tariffs. He gave automakers a reprieve, and then he gave everybody a reprieve for a month. And that is related to some of the economic data that he is hearing from his staff. I mean, one thing that the president understands is inflation. And so you have his economic staff saying that, look, there is a possibility that these tariffs are going to lead to higher prices. And I think the president is in this moment where two things colliding. He believes in tariffs, that's something very real for him, and he's also very aware of the pain that inflation causes and the political damage that it causes. HASNIE: Obviously, this is kind of a gamble," and we will see how it plays out for the White House and for this president. I have to get to this report from """"The New York Times"""" because it dropped this afternoon and it was kind of something that I think a lot of were waiting for. We wanted to get inside the room when Elon Musk is there with President Trump and all the cabinet secretaries. What do they really think? And here's a piece from """"The New York Times"""" here. This is about a meeting with Marco Rubio and Elon Musk", and they're discussing cuts. And it says," """"Seated diagonally opposite across the elliptical mahogany table Elon Musk was letting Mr. Rubio have it", accusing him of failing to slash his staff. Mr. Musk was not being truthful, Mr. Rubio said. What about the more than 1,500 State Department officials who took early retirement and buyouts? Didn't they count as layoffs? After the argument dragged on for an uncomfortable time," Mr. Trump finally intervened to defend Mr. Rubio as doing a great job."""" And he said later", Trump said that there was no clash at all between Musk and Rubio. Hugh, how do you see what's going on here, because some of these secretaries are feeling a little uncomfortable according to this reporting, including Doug Collins over at the V.A.? HEWITT: I like a sparky meeting. I think a sparky meeting is what makes for a very good meeting. And I'll bet you that everyone walked away with a very clear understanding of what the president likes, which is conflict between strong people. Secretary Rubio is very smart. Elon Musk is very smart. I wish that was on tape. We could run that 24/7 role. I'd watch that. HASNIE: I would love for it to be on tape. Matt, I'll give you the final word, because sometimes I read these articles, and I think if they have got five sources, somebody is trying to get Elon Musk to go away within the White House. BENNETT: No question. I mean, cabinet secretary does not like babysitters. And the DOGE guys are their babysitters, and they're pushing them to do things that they don't want to do. And I think, importantly, the reason that Musk is becoming more unpopular and it's having an effect on Trump's popularity is because he is bringing chaos where Trump promised order. And that's the opposite of what he would campaign on. HASNIE: We'll see if we can get any more stories from inside the Oval Office. Thank you all for being here with us. And it's Friday, so you know what time it is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The first thing I do when I wake up is do a backflip because I can. DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: Tomorrow tariffs 25 percent on Canada and 25 percent on Mexico. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is a very dumb thing to do. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We will be relentless, and we will not stop. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I didn't think any of that rhetoric was useful. GOV. RON DESANTIS, (R-FL): And 3.3 million visitors from Canada. Maybe they wanted to get a glimpse of what a Stanley Cup winning hockey team actually looks like. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: There will be a little disturbance. BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: This was the most boisterous, the longest, the most partisan speech I have ever heard a president give in this kind of setting. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It was the first time I thought of them as a zombie party. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Somebody slap me and wake me the -- up. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We are going to speak lies to his truth. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Elon, can we get your cell phone numbers? Are you giving it out? TRUMP: Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Reagan must be rolling in his grave. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Where are the peacenik hippies now? And I kind of like it. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's a collage of idiocy. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Remove this gentleman from the chamber. MARK WAHLBERG: With God as the center of your life, you've got a better chance to succeed. TRUMP: I am asking our new Secret Service director to officially make you an agent of the United States Secret Service. (APPLAUSE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I was not expecting that. (END VIDEO CLIP) HASNIE: Best moment of the week. Monday on SPECIAL REPORT, as the clock ticks down towards a government shutdown, we're going to look at the Republican plan. Plus, join Shannon Bream for FOX NEWS SUNDAY. Her guests include South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, Trump hostage envoy Adam Boehler," and Democratic California Congressman Ro Khanna.

Taking a chunk out of the Green New Deal, President Trump's EPA chief makes some big changes. Transgenders in the military, a major hearing on a challenge to the new Pentagon policy. And SpaceX prepares to launch a new crew for the International Space Station and finally bring the two stranded NASA astronauts home. But first, breaking tonight, President Trump says he is taking back wealth that was stolen by other countries. He is increasing tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to 25 percent. Canada and the European Union are matching the move and raising import taxes on several other U.S. made products. President Trump is participating in a St. Patrick's Day reception in the East Room. He has spent time today with the Irish Taoiseach Micheal Martin, all of this comes as the Labor Department announces a drop in inflation for the first time since September. Correspondent Alexandria Hoff is at the White House tonight and kicks off our coverage. Good evening, Alex. ALEXANDRIA HOFF, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening too, John. Yes, the two leaders have spent a lot of time together today, and this annual tradition seeks to reinforce the long standing diplomatic relationship between Ireland and the U.S., but it was made complicated this year by economic tension. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: E.U. was set up in order to take advantage of the United States. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Including Ireland, is Ireland taking advantage of the U.S.? TRUMP: Of course, they are. HOFF (voice over): President Trump highlighting Ireland's hold on American Pharmaceutical companies as an example of prior U.S. leadership dropping the ball. TRUMP: I'm not upset with you. I think I respect what you've done. HOFF (voice over): The president telling Ireland's Taoiseach or Prime Minister Micheal Martin that the U.S. would never do anything to hurt his country. The island is a member of the European Union, which today responded to President Trump's 25 percent duty on aluminum and steel imports by announcing $28 billion in counter tariffs on American goods set to take effect next month. URSULA VON DER LEYEN, PRESIDENT, EUROPEAN COMMISSION: It is not in our common interest to burden our economies with such tariffs. We are ready to engage in a meaningful dialog. HOFF (voice over): Canada also announcing $20 billion in reciprocal tariffs impacting steel, aluminum, computers and sports equipment that will go into effect tomorrow, the same day that Ontario Premier Doug Ford is set to meet with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick following a tariff threat ping pong yesterday that resulted in Ford suspending a 25 percent surcharge in electricity exported to the U.S. HOWARD LUTNICK, U.S. COMMERCE SECRETARY: We're going to lower the temperature. You know, he thought he'd be sort of the big man and tackle Donald Trump. But, you know you can't tackle Donald Trump. HOFF (voice over): The White House also weighing in on a slight inflation cool down. The Labor Department released that the Consumer Price Index, which measures the price of everyday goods, increased 0.2 percent in February, which is less than anticipated. PETER NAVARRO, WHITE HOUSE SENIOR TRADE COUNSELOR: What we saw today was a beautiful number, great news for the American people. (END VIDEOTAPE) HOFF (on camera): Now, the latest inflation data does not measure the impact of the latest tariffs. On today's festivities, several political leaders from Northern Ireland, that is, they boycotted this trip to Washington over the administration stance on Gaza. When asked about that today, the president said he was not aware of these boycotts, John. ROBERTS: All right, Alex Hoff at 1600 Pennsylvania. Thank you, Alex. The positive inflation news helped stocks stabilize a little bit today, the Dow lost 83, the S&P 500 was up a little more than 27, the NASDAQ up more than 212. Tonight, Senate Republicans are trying to find enough Democratic votes to break a filibuster and pass a stop gap funding bill. Without the Democrats, the federal government could shut down early Saturday morning. Our Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram, tells us where things stand tonight. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Senate Democrats rejecting the funding measure which eat through the House. SEN. LISA BLUNT ROCHESTER (D-DE): We were told this was a clean C.R. It's not a clean C.R. It's basically a dirty deal. PERGRAM (voice over): A congressional conundrum, break a filibuster to fund the government or take the blame for a shutdown. SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA): It's fish or cut bait time for Senator Schumer. He's got to either urinate or get off the pot. PERGRAM (voice over): But Schumer insists Democrats won't help. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): Republicans do not have the votes in the Senate to invoke cloture on the House C.R. PERGRAM (voice over): Republicans control the Senate, but in this case, need up to eight Democrats to break a filibuster. Most Democrats ducking their dilemma. PERGRAM: Would you vote to end the filibuster on the C.R., Senator? You wouldn't vote to overcome the filibuster on the C.R., would you? SEN. THOM TILLIS (R-NC): It seems like they're trying to test the waters for whether or not they cannot assume responsibility if the government shuts down on Friday night. PERGRAM (voice over): However, Pennsylvania's John Fetterman is one Democrat who would vote with the GOP to avoid a shutdown. SEN. JOHN FETTERMAN (D-PA): If we do know and vote to close it, to claim that, to protect the government, again, that's, you know, I've described it. It's like, you know, burning down the village to save it. PERGRAM (voice over): House progressives sending a message to their colleagues. REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL (D-WA): Senate Democrats need to hold the line and not pass this funding bill. (END VIDEOTAPE) PERGRAM (on camera): Also, another Senate Democrat announced their retirement today, 78-year-old Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire will not seek a fourth term next year. She is the third Senate Democrat from a swing state to call it quits this year, John. ROBERTS: Chad Pergam with all the news from Capitol Hill. Chad, thank you. PERGRAM: Thank you. ROBERTS: Also breaking tonight, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency is announcing rollbacks to landmark environmental regulations, including rules on pollution from coal fired power plants, climate change and electric vehicles. Fox Business Correspondent Grady Trimble is with us here tonight to take a look at the numbers. Good evening, Grady. GRADY TRIMBLE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, John. And the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency is rolling back a slew of Biden era environmental regulations, 31 to be precise, in what EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin calls the most consequential day of deregulation in American history. As part of his announcement today, Zeldin is making good on one of President Trump's key campaign promises, the EPA will roll back vehicle tail pipe emission standards the Biden administration put into place that, in the Trump administration's view, amounts to an electric vehicle mandate. The EPA is also undoing regulations on power plants, reconsidering the agency's 2009 finding that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health and the environment, and eliminating offices within the agency that deal with environmental justice and Diversity Equity and Inclusion, or DEI. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LEE ZELDIN, EPA ADMINISTRATOR: EPA will be reconsidering many suffocating rules that restrict nearly every sector of our economy. Today, the green new scam ends as the EPA does its part to usher in the golden age of American success. TRIMBLE (voice over): Zeldin says rolling back these rules will cut trillions of dollars in regulatory costs and hidden taxes, reducing prices to buy a car, heat your home and run a business, but climate activists say the move will slow progress on tackling climate change and harm minority communities disproportionately impacted by it. The head of the Sierra Club says there's only one purpose to Lee Zeldin's announcement, to allow big polluters to continue cutting corners. This disgraceful action will only further endanger the most vulnerable Americans. (END VIDEOTAPE) TRIMBLE (on camera): But industry groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, they are in support of Zeldin's move. One organization representing the auto industry says more balanced rules on greenhouse gas emissions for cars could help preserve vehicle choice in the United States and keep the industry competitive globally. ROBERTS: So, we get to keep our gas stoves? TRIMBLE: For now, it sounds like it, for the next four years. ROBERTS: Grady, good to see you. Thanks so much. Top officials at the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement say the Biden administration was cooking the books when it comes to arrests of illegal immigrants. Senior officials tell Fox News that ICE found tens of thousands of cases that were recorded as arrests that were in fact, cases of illegal immigrants being processed and then released into American communities. As of yesterday, ICE arrests for this year surpassed all of last year's at large criminal arrests. Former Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil will remain detained in Louisiana until at least next week. This comes following an initial court hearing in New York over the Trump administration's plans to deport him for his role in campus protests against Israel. The brief hearing drew hundreds of demonstrators to the federal courthouse in lower Manhattan to denounce the arrest of Khalil, a legal permanent U.S. resident who was married to an American citizen. All right, tonight, as we pursue the first 100 days, we take a look at the top stories and dig down a little deeper on them with Fox News Chief Political Analyst Brit Hume. Kind of a jump ball, Brit, on where to begin tonight. But why don't we start with the surprising news on inflation, down 0.2 of a percentage point, month over month, down to 2.8 percent year over year, the core inflation rate at 3.1 percent. That is good news in anyone's books. BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: It is, but it's not a huge drop, but it's big enough to matter to people, I think. And the main thing is that it wasn't an increase at a moment when inflation has been remarkably persistent, despite the fact that the Biden administration under which it began is gone now. So, obviously, any good news on this front is welcome to everyone. We'll see how it plays out in the weeks ahead. ROBERTS: But there's perhaps a ticking time bomb out there, because February, there were no tariffs in place. They're all starting to take effect now. And Canada and the E.U. are engaging in reciprocal tariffs, ones that are specifically targeted to try to hit the president where he lives. This in the Associated Press, ""E.U. officials have made clear that the tariffs taxes on imports are aimed at products made in Republican held states, such as beef and poultry from Kansas and Nebraska and wood products from Alabama and Georgia."" I recall that they did this before during the first Trump administration. Wasn't to great effect, but I think that the president didn't like it. HUME: The remarkable thing is, this is president who's been committed to cutting taxes, and the Republican Party has been committed to cutting taxes for long, for as long, John, as you and I can remember. But here we are in the early phases of this administration, and definitely they want to cut -- keep the income taxes as low as they can and all that. But the first taxes they're really seeing that are being put into effect are higher, because that's -- that in fact is -- that's what tariffs are. Their taxes on goods that are being imported into this country are exported from it. And the tendency of tariffs in the short run, particular is to suppress economic activity, and of course, it also is to drive up prices, and that's how it suppresses economic activity. So, it's something I think the administration has to worry about, although it obviously believes that in the long run, the tariffs will be beneficial and our industries will thrive, and people will build factories here, and maybe they will, but that's not something is going to happen to keep prices down next week, next month, or even next year. So, we have a way to go here. May take a while for the -- for the tariffs to work their way into products, but the chances of higher prices, it seems to me, from tariffs, is a legitimate concern. ROBERTS: All right. Brit Hume for us with the breakdown on where we're headed in terms of the economy and inflation. Thank you, Brit, good to see you. HUME: You bet. ROBERTS: All right. Up next, we talk With Fox News Senior Correspondent Benjamin Hall about the first 100 days of the Trump administration's foreign policy, and Benjamin's latest book, Resolute. First, here's a look at what some of our fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. Fox 32 in Chicago as police questioned a man in connection with an early morning shooting at O'Hare Airport. A fight between several people spilled out from the terminal, that's terminal number two into the arrival lanes of traffic. A 25-year-old man was shot twice in the lower body. He is listed in stable condition. Fox 31 in Denver as state senators pass a proposal requiring a criminal background check and safety course for people who want to buy semi- automatic guns with detachable magazines. If passed, Colorado would join roughly a dozen other states that require some kind of safety training or exam to purchase a firearm. And this is a live look at Lake Tahoe from Fox 11, one of the big stories there tonight, Nevada lawmakers hear a resolution that supports the therapeutic use of some psychedelic drugs. State senators want Congress to consider expanding psychedelic medicine practices and research on the federal level. And that's tonight's live look outside the Beltway from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ROBERTS: Ukrainian officials say Russian ballistic missiles killed at least five civilians today. The attack comes one day after the Trump administration lifted its suspension of military aid for Kyiv's fight against Russia's invasion, and Ukrainian officials signal that they were open to a 30-day ceasefire. The Kremlin did not comment on the agreement that was announced yesterday between the U.S. and Ukraine. And as we continue our look at the first 100 days of the Trump administration, we focus tonight on foreign policy. And joining us tonight, we've got the pleasure of welcoming our Fox News senior correspondent Benjamin Hall, the author of the new book, ""Resolute: How We Humans Keep Finding Ways To Beat The Toughest Odds"". Benji, good to see you again. BENJAMIN HALL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Great to see you, John. ROBERTS: So, I guess when you look at foreign policy for the Trump administration, there is two really big stories. There is the Middle East, and then, there is Ukraine and Russia, which is really the one that's on the front burner. And the question that everybody has tonight is, when Steve Witkoff goes to meet with Putin, will Putin be open to the ceasefire agreement that was struck between the U.S. and Ukraine? HALL: Well, it's a very interesting question. We don't quite know how Putin will play this. But we do know that President Trump is going to use the same tactic he uses President Zelenskyy, carrot and stick. He has already said clearly that if President Putin doesn't come to the table and agree to the ceasefire, that there could be heavy sanctions and financial problems for Russia. It's not really about this 30-day ceasefire, however, it's what comes next. It is the longer-term peace deal. And on that, the two sides, Ukraine and Russia, differ in many, many ways. And so, I think we might see some progress made on the ceasefire. We think President Trump will talk with President Putin in the next few days, but it's what comes next is the long-term security guarantees that people are considering. ROBERTS: And what does Ukraine give up? What does Russia give up? There's no indication for Putin that he's willing to evacuate from the Donbas. HALL: No. Both sides been very clear. The Donbass and all three eastern provinces of Ukraine have been annexed by Russia, and Putin says they will never cease being Russian. President Zelenskyy said just a couple days ago that they would never give up any territorial gains officially to Russia. So, that is a major stumbling block. Neither side is going to give anything up, but a peace deal requires concessions from both parties. And you expect both parties to start off at either end, and hopefully President Trump can bring them together to meet somewhere in the middle. ROBERTS: We'll see if he can. He calls himself the world's greatest negotiator. I want to get to your new book, ""Resolute,"" which is launching this week. Congratulations on all of this. HALL: Thank you. ROBERTS: You talk in this book about the saving power of the human spirit, which you discovered after the horrific incident in Ukraine. Here is what you write in part: ""A truly seismic event interrupted my life, knocked me off my chosen course, and as much as I may have wanted to return to the person I used to be, I understood I was already someone very different. Trauma disrupts our core belief systems, forcing us to rethink our place in the world, our future, ourselves. We have it in us to emerge from the darkest tragedy stronger, better, and more capable. It doesn't take superhuman strength to tap into our inner resilience. This remarkable power is already within us, waiting for us to deploy it."" During save, you told -- your first book, you told your story. But this really is an inspiring story for anyone who is going through adversity. HALL: I hope so. You know, so many people reached out to me after save came out, and they want to know more about how I got through the most difficult moments. And actually, in this book, I talk about some of the toughest moments and how I got through them. But what I say in that little chapter, that little excerpt right there, is that we can get out of anything traumatic, and we can be stronger on the other side. And that is something I was not expecting. And I think that you can do so by adapting. And there are so many times through my journey that I had to adapt. I had to find other ways. And I honestly stand here today, sit here today, saying that anyone going through something traumatic, whether that is financial problems, whether that is family issues, anxiety, they can find a way to get through that challenge. And I now feel that any challenge faces me can be broken down, and it's a remarkable place to be, and I only learned that when my back was up against the wall, when I was badly injured, and I wasn't certain how he's going to get through it. But now, I know that everyone can follow the same techniques, they can use the same methods. This book is not a self-help book. I've tried to tell the story through other people's stories, through my story, so, I hope that it reads very well, but I do hope it will inspire some people. And I suppose more than anything, I want people to read and I want to get back to me, because I think again, dialog, talking about it, is essential. ROBERTS: if you can come back in the way that you have from what happened to you, and we see all of these other inspirational stories too about wounded warriors out there, every day, they are coming across our screen. It's got to be inspirational to some folks at home. HALL: Well, I hope it will be. And there are so many resilient people out there. And I think that, you know, we've got to keep telling the stories of resilience. You know, we live in a pretty divided and fractured world right now, but there is a strong moral backbone that we all share. And if you look for that strong moral backbone, it's something that is wide across this country, and I've been traveling around the U.S. looking for it, and it is there, and we can build it up, and we will be a stronger nation because of it. ROBERTS: Well, it's a great book. Congratulations on the release. HALL: Thank you. ROBERTS: Congratulations on the new daughter. We both have sages now. HALL: Yes, we do. They can change the world, John. ROBERTS: Benji, great to see you. HALL: You too. ROBERTS: Thank you. Up next, trans rights activists try to stop the Pentagon's new policy, barring transgenders from serving in the military. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ROBERTS: President Trump has formally nominated retired Air Force Lieutenant General Dan Razin Caine, to be Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The president made the initial announcement last Friday in the same social media post in which he fired Air Force General C.Q. Brown Jr., who served just 16 months as the country's top military official. President Trump has said to favor Caine because of his success against ISIS terrorists. Caine is said to be well-liked and non-partisan. Trans rights groups are trying to halt the Pentagon's new policy of barring transgenders from military service. That was the subject of a hearing today. Correspondent David Spunt tells us what happened from the justice department. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT (voice over): A federal judge appearing inclined to deal another blow to President Trump's executive order, banning transgender members of the military from actively serving, signed at the end of January, the president's order served as the nexus to this memo from a Pentagon official one month later, proclaiming surgical and mental health constraints are ""incompatible with the high mental and physical standards necessary for military service."" Today in court, Biden-appointed judge, Ana Reyes, chastised to the DOJ for being ""unprepared"" and compared the amount the Pentagon spent on gender dysphoria treatment, to the amount the Pentagon spends on Viagra. She says 42 million on Viagra in 2024 and 52 million on gender dysphoria care over 10 years. Gender dysphoria is defined as stress one experiences from recognizing themselves as another gender than what was assigned at birth. Since 2015, about 1,000 people serving received gender transitioning surgery. There are about 2.2 million people serving in active duty and reserve roles. The plaintiff in this case, Army Reserve Second Lieutenant Nick Talbott. SECOND LIEUTENANT NICOLAS TALBOTT, U.S. ARMY RESERVE: I remember being wee little, witnessing the events of 9/11, 2001. That's kind of something that really sparked an inspiration in me to want to serve and help take care of my fellow Americans. SPUNT: Talbott transitioned from female to male in 2012 and is proud to serve. TALBOTT: I was treated the same as everybody else. I showed unjust like everyone else. I performed just like everyone else, and there was no disruption whatsoever caused simply by my presence. (END VIDEO TAPE) SPUNT: John, this case could end up on the steps of the Supreme Court on the merits later this year. John? ROBERTS: And David, a big ruling today that blocks one of the president's executive orders. What can you tell us about that? SPUNT: That's right. That's from a federal judge here in Washington, D.C. This was an executive order signed last week targeting the law firm Perkins Coie. It's a law firm with offices across the country, connections to Hillary Clinton and the 2016 Steele dossier. President Trump said that in his executive order that Perkins Coie presents a danger. The firm, as I mentioned, known for ties to Clinton, eventually the Steele dossier. A lawyer representing the firm argued that executive order is unconstitutional and unfairly targets the firm by trying to keep employees out of federal buildings. It's possible and likely the Justice Department will appeal. John? ROBERTS: All right, we'll keep watching that. David Spunt for us at the DOJ. David, thank you. President Trump wants to label a tax against Tesla dealerships as domestic terrorism. Many of the company's stores and charging stations across the country have been vandalized in recent weeks to protest Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. Senior correspondent Alicia Acuna reports tonight from Loveland, Colorado. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) ALICIA ACUNA, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Federal and state prosecutors in Colorado says this Tesla storefront in Loveland was vandalized six times in three months, charging Lucy Grace Nelson, a transgender woman, for throwing Molotov cocktails and painting anti-Elon Musk graffiti. In Washington state, Seattle police say fire destroyed four Tesla cyber trucks at a dealership on Sunday. At a separate location someone spraypainted swastikas on six cyber trucks. In Oregon, two Tesla storefronts were damaged by gunfire, one also hit with a Molotov cocktail. In the months since Elon Musk began his cost-cutting work with the Department of Government Efficiency, vandals have targeted Tesla stores and charging stations nationwide, and Tesla vehicle owners say they are also feeling the blowback against Musk. THERESA RAMSDELL, TESLA OWNERS WASHINGTON CLUB: It's been a lot of middle fingers, it's been a lot of gagging gestures, that kind of stuff. Hollering yes, that's not a truck, especially when I'm driving the cyber truck. ACUNA: Recently, someone rode up on Theresa Ramsdell's cyber truck in traffic and placed an anti-Elon sticker on the back. RAMSDELL: When I was stopped at the traffic light, I heard two knocks on the back of my truck. It's just like, oh, geez. OK, what happened? ACUNA: And in San Francisco, fliers popping up urging Tesla owners to sell their vehicles. ELON MUSK, CEO, TESLA: Tesla's quarter, Tesla owners, Tesla stores, these are innocent people who have done nothing wrong. ACUNA: Musk has thanked supporters, even as Tesla sales have dropped and protesters demonstrate at store fronts. (END VIDEO TAPE) ACUNA (on camera): Law enforcement hasn't said if these vandal attacks appear coordinated, but Seattle's FBI office says it's working with the ATF to determine if any of these incidents rise to the level of a federal crime. John? ROBERTS: Wow, from here to goat. Alicia Acuna for us. Alicia, thank you. We are about an hour away now from the scheduled launch of a SpaceX mission to bring home two astronauts who have been aboard the International Space Station since last June. Correspondent Jonathan Serrie is at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida tonight. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) SUNI WILLIAMS, NASA ASTRONAUT: I promise you, we are actively trying to find the passage back to the place we were before. JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Astronaut Suni Williams handed over command of the International Space Station as she and fellow test pilot Butch Wilmore prepare to return from nine months in space. It started last June for what was supposed to be an eight-day flight test of Boeing's new Starliner spacecraft which developed intermittent thruster problems on the way up to the space station. Boeing determined the issue could be managed safely for the return flight, but NASA decided not to risk it and brought Starliner home autonomously in early September. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And lift off. SERRIE: Reassigning the two test pilots to the incoming crew nine mission that launched an American, a Russian, and two empty seats on a SpaceX capsule in late September. All four will ride home in that capsule a few days after the arrival of the next astronaut rotation, Crew 10. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's what your human spaceflight program is all about, planning for unknown, unexpected contingencies. We did that. SERRIE: But the timing has become political with President Trump calling on SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to expedite Butch and Suni's return. DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: We love you and we are coming up to get you. And you shouldn't have been up there so long. SERRIE: NASA officials say they had already been planning an expedited return to get ahead of a busy launch schedule in April. Swapping a new SpaceX capsule that was delayed in production for an older model allows Crew 10 to launch today instead of late March. KEN BOWERSOX, NASA ASSOCIATE ADMINISTRATOR: But the president's interest sure added energy to the conversation, and it's great to have a president who is interested in what we're doing. (END VIDEO TAPE) SERRIE (on camera): And Crew 10 will attempt to launch this evening at 7:48 eastern time, docking with the International Space Station tomorrow morning. After a brief handover period, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will board their own capsule with the other two members of Crew 9 and undock from the space station on Sunday, beginning their very short ride back to the earth. John? ROBERTS: Eight days that turned into nine months. It's like a space age ""Gilligan's Island"". Thank you, Jonathan. We look forward to the lunch. (LAUGHTER) ROBERTS: By the way, you can see the launch live here on THE INGRAHAM ANGLE coming up in our next hour. Up next, Bret Baier continues his series on the timeline of the coronavirus pandemic five years ago now. And, later, the panel on the Trump economy and tariffs. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ROBERTS: We continue our series looking at the coronavirus pandemic here on SPECIAL REPORT. on the five year anniversary of the outbreak in the United States, tonight Bret Baier looks at how local and federal leaders initially tried to slow the spread. BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Thanks, John. In our last installment, we looked at the initial response in China. Tonight, we look back at March of 2020 here in the U.S. At the time, we did not have a lot of information. Leaders issued recommendations and then some mandates. But some of that guidance shifted a great deal over time. Here's a look-back five years later how it all unfolded. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: Joe is not going to be running the government. He is just going to be sitting in a home someplace. BAIER: At the end of February President Trump was balancing his presidential campaign and the response to the emerging coronavirus epidemic in the United States. TRUMP: Ladies and gentlemen, we will be doing this quite often. We're going to keep you abreast of all of the facts. BAIER: We were doing the same with our news coverage as we traveled across the country ahead of the election. MICHAEL BLOOMBERG, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Nobody know what is this virus is going to do. It does seem to be spreading. BAIER: Virginia had no known coronavirus cases at the time, and with Asia and Europe reporting the majority of the illnesses, the virus still seemed far away, and the election season remained the top priority. Good evening from FOX News world headquarters, welcome to Super Tuesday. As Super Tuesday states reported election results, some also reported new coronavirus cases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had confirmed at least 60 total across the U.S. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do masks actually help? DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF MEDICAL ADVISER: The most important thing for mask would be if someone is infected to prevent them from infecting others. The other is the healthcare provider, to protect them. It doesn't provide the kind of protection that people think it does. BAIER: White House officials urged Americans to take additional protective measures. DR. DEBORAH BIRX, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE COORDINATOR: We are always saying the common sense of washing your hands, not touching your face. TRUMP: And I haven't touched my face in weeks, in weeks. (LAUGHTER) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. President. TRUMP: I miss it. BAIER: You are a self-proclaimed germophobe. In the campaign, before the campaign, doesn't like to shake hands. You changed that. What do doctors -- TRUMP: I'm no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 yes, you're not thrilled. TRUMP: If there was ever a time that you could convince people not to shake hand, this could be it. BAIER: While not cases were reported yet in Pennsylvania, other states were seeing rapid increases. ANDREW CUOMO, FORMER NEW YORK GOVERNOR: That's 22 statewide. MIKE PENCE, (R) FORMER U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: Seventy confirmed cases in Washington state. BAIER: And in many places, there was urgent need for test kits. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you concerned that the virus is more widespread than originally thought because of the lack of testing? TRUMP: No, no, no. BAIER: The Trump administration was working to increase testing. The first coronavirus relief bill would dedicate funds to do so. But increased testing would bring an increase in confirmed cases, prompting state and local leaders to cancel large events. STEVE ADLER, AUSTIN, TEXAS, MAYOR: I have issued an order that effectively cancels South by Southwest. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have decided to postpone the Ultra Music Festival. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are they overreacting or are they taking the right precautions? TRUMP: I think it's fine if they want to do it. I don't think it's an overreaction. But I wouldn't be generally inclined to do it, I really wouldn't be generally inclined to do it. I really wouldn't be. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Good evening, everybody. BAIER: The next week we traveled to Michigan for what would be our last large event of the 2020 election season. SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, (I-VT): What happens if you have that virus and you are going to work? You are spreading it to other people. BAIER: Health officials updated guidance for high risk Americans, calling for increased use of protective equipment and distancing measures. FAUCI: I would recommend strongly that they do not go on a cruise ship. Personally I would not go on cruise ship because I don't like cruises. BAIER: Soon enough, that guidance would extend to all Americans. Breaking tonight, America is changing how it works, goes to school, or doesn't. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There's no soccer, there's no football, there's not basketball. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Actors Tom Hans and Rita Wilson announcing they've tested positive for the virus. BAIER: New York banned large gatherings of 500 people or more. The NBA and NHL seasons were suspended. And Americans were urged to maintain distance from one another. REP. NANCY PELOSI, (D-CA): Eastern style. TRUMP: At the same time we did this. BAIER: Even Dr. Fauci gave it old chicken wing on Capitol Hill. TRUMP: Two very big words. BAIER: By the end of the week, President Trump had declared a national emergency, and his two remaining White House competitors moved their campaigns online. SANDERS: Under normal circumstances I would not be in Burlington today. I would be probably in Ohio, Florida. JOE BIDEN, (D) FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Campaign events are no exception. That's why we are connecting virtually today. BAIER: As the next week began, the Trump administration's recommendations became more urgent. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you telling governors in those states then to close all their restaurants? TRUMP: We haven't said that yet. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why not? TRUMP: We are recommending -- we are recommending things. We haven't gone to that step yet. That could happen, but we haven't gone there yet. Much of what we're talking about is for the next 15 days. BAIER: Saint Patrick's day celebrations had already been canceled in New York and Chicago. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: People are going to call us all day asking us do we have corn beef and cabbage. But yes, we are closed. BAIER: Fewer visitors took in Washington's cherry blossoms, and spring breakers faced limited options in Florida. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What is there to do here other than to go to the bars and beach. And they are closing all of it. BAIER: States began setting up hospital beds wherever they found space, from a naval ship in New York Harbor from to a soccer field in Washington state. Health officials called for additional equipment to treat the increasing number of cases. States began to issue stay at home orders, including those we had visited just weeks before. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I ask all Pennsylvanians to stay home. CUOMO: New York state on pause. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today I'm issuing a stay-home, stay-safe executive order for all Michiganders. TRUMP: We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself. We are not going to let the cure be worse than the problem. (END VIDEO TAPE) BAIER: Before March came to a close, social distancing recommendations were extended through the end of April. Another coronavirus bill would put stimulus checks in the pockets of Americans, and White House news conferences would continue almost nightly at, yes, around 6:00 p.m., the time of SPECIAL REPORT. We'll take a look at those in our next installment as we look back five years later at COVID. We'll send it back to you. ROBERTS: All right, it almost seems like watching a bad movie again. Bret, thank you. Up next, the panel on the Trump economy and tariffs. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: We will be stronger than ever before. I think the markets are going to soar. The United States of America is going to take back a lot of what was stolen from it by other countries, and by, frankly, incompetent U.S. leadership. SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, (D-CT): What Donald Trump is doing now is potentially going to disrupt disastrously a success story for America. DAVID SOLOMON, GOLDMAN SACHS CEO: We're in a period of change. We have an incredibly nimble and versatile economy. And I'm sure we'll make progress and move forward. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: Views on where the economy is now and where it's headed with all the tariffs that are kicking in. Let's bring in our panel, Josh Kraushaar is FOX News Radio political analyst, Jason Riley," """"Wall Street Journal"""" columnist and senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute"," and """"USA Today"""" White House correspondent Francesca Chambers. Jason", let's start with you because your venerable newspaper doesn't like the idea of tariffs at all, has made that quite clear. Yet we see some good news on the economy today with the consumer price index down a little bit to 2.8 percent. That's good news for Trump. JASON RILEY, COLUMNIST," """"WALL STREET JOURNAL"""": It is good news. It's always good news when inflation is down. I'm not sure I would quite spike the ball yet", John, however. There are signs that there is some trouble out there. First of all, those numbers do not include food and energy, as was mentioned earlier. Food prices are, in fact, up. Also, we know that that data was collected before Trump's actions on tariffs. So we don't know how his actions on tariffs will affect inflation going forward. But it is good news that inflation is down. I do think there are some other things to be concerned about in the economy, that a jobs report last week said we added about 150,000 jobs last month. But that's half of what was added in November. ROBERTS: But 10,000 were in manufacturing. RILEY: But half of what we added in November and December. So markets are a little skittish about what is going on out there. But yes, it's good news that inflation is down. ROBERTS: In terms of what might be ahead, Josh, this morning from the America Automotive Policy Council, his tariffs on steel and aluminum go in effect. It said," """"Revoking the exception for Canada and Mexico and extending tariffs to auto parts with steel and aluminum will add significant cost for automakers", suppliers," and consumers."""" So maybe the good news in the CPI is short-lived? JOSH KRAUSHAAR", FOX NEWS RADIO POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes, a good rule of politics is, first, do no harm. And look, the tariffs are going to raise prices for consumers looking to buy a new car. That's going to likely go up as a result of this trade war. And you can see the president's job approval ratings on the economy starting to take a hit. There was a new CNN poll that came out today showing he had a lower economic approval score right now than he did throughout his whole first term. So, look, I think -- ROBERTS: Let's put that up on the screen so people can know while you are chatting about it. Go ahead. KRAUSHAAR: Yes. But I think there is a lot of opportunity. I think the economy certainly, you know, is something that he wanted to remake and bring more jobs to the United States. That's the goal that Trump has stated that he -- why he wants to impose these tariffs. But there's a lot of costs that could come down the road and there are a lot of political costs that this White House has to be concerned about. ROBERTS: Francesca, do you want to take on the economy or move on to education and the Education Department? FRANCESCA CHAMBERS," """"USA TODAY"""": Well", I just wanted to add it was a 56 percent disapproval rating on the economy. But the approval rating for tariffs would be even lower, 39 percent of Americans approved of the tariff policy. ROBERTS: Unless you are in the steel and aluminum industry, then you love it? CHAMBERS: And just to tack on to what Jason was saying, he has paused many of these tariffs so far. Many of these will take effect on April 2nd, whether those be reciprocal on many nations or those be on specific countries such as Canada and Mexico. And he's punted on the automotive tariffs, too. So we may not know what the effect of all of these things are really until we start seeing the data that comes out in May. ROBERTS: All right, so let's move to education with you, Jason. Here is what the president and the former education secretary said under Ronald Reagan said about potentially closing the Department of Education. Listen here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: We are going to move education into the states so that the states, instead of bureaucrats working in Washington, so that the states can run education. BILL BENNETT, FORMER EDUCATION SECRETARY: You want to send the money out to the states, fine. But let's evaluate how the states are doing. Let's see who thrives and who doesn't, and then let's take the best practices for the states that thrive and give those practices to other states to imitate. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: That is an interesting voice in this because he was Ronald Reagan's secretary of education. Ronald Reagan vowed in 1980 and again in 1982 in the State of the Union addressed to shutter the Department of Education but he couldn't do it because Democrats controlled the House. RILEY: Right. It will probably take an act of Congress to in fact shutter it. But I do like this effort to dismantle it as much as possible short of that. Bill Bennett is right. This should mostly be state issue. This is a department that came about in the 1970s under Jimmy Carter as a favor to the teachers' unions for supporting him. And it largely continues to mostly support the teachers' unions and not the kids. There is no evidence that test scores or learning is up since there has been a Department of Education. And all of their core functions, whether it's civil rights enforcement could be done by the Justice Department. Student loans could be managed by treasury. So, there are no core functions that couldn't be handled by other departments. The rest of is a bunch of bureaucrats looking out for teachers' unions, in other words, the adults in the system rather than the kids. ROBERTS: You mentioned test scores. Here's what the National Assessment of Education of Progress found in 2024. In math, fourth grade students, 39 percent of them were proficient. That number goes down. By the time you get to eighth grade. And then in reading it was 31 percent and in eighth grade 30 percent. Francesca, the numbers are going in the wrong direction here. CHAMBERS: But Democrats are not going to vote, as you were talking about, to dismantle the Department of Education. They simply do not have the votes in the House and the Senate. So what the Trump administration is doing is the only thing they really can do, which is try to eliminate positions and specifically hollow out departments where they disagree with what they're doing. But, of course, the concern now is that is if they get rid of 50 percent of those positions, then it doubles work potentially on other people who were then left in the department. ROBERTS: I think that the argument that the Trump administration, certainly DOGE is making, is that of those 1,300 people, how many of them are actually engaged in any kind of meaningful work. And Elon Musk proved that you can fire 80 percent of the people who were working at X and the platforms is doing fine. KRAUSHAAR: This is one of the agencies that I think DOGE can make these cuts and it won't hurt the president's political standing. There's a lot of waste. The issue that Republicans used post 2020 to come back politically in states and the federal government was education. The poor test scores, the COVID rules that kept schools closed. There's a lot of dissatisfaction about the public school bureaucracies, the teachers' unions, as Jason was talking about. And there is a lot of frustration. I don't think people are going to miss much about the bureaucracy. ROBERTS: Yes, a lot of people were saying take the money that you pay those federal workers and give it to the states to handle education, because that's what they do anyways. Panel, great to see you tonight. Thank you so much for joining us. Tomorrow on SPECIAL REPORT, President Trump is going to host the NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte at the White House. Remember, if you cannot catch us live, set your DVR, 6:00 p.m. in the east," 3:00 p.m. on the west coast. Thanks so much for watching SPECIAL REPORT. I'm John Roberts in Washington.

Have a great night, everybody. BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Really cute, Jesse, thank you. Good evening. I'm Bret Baier. We are sorting through the thousands of documents relating to John F. Kennedy's assassination. We'll have the highlights for you here. Energy Secretary Chris Wright joins us to discuss President Trump's meeting with big oil executives today and the plan to unleash an American energy agenda. We also speak with the president of the Democratic Republic of Congo on the effort to find peace in Central Africa and a possible new minerals deal with the U.S. But first, breaking tonight, we have new Fox polls that show President Donald Trump's approval rating is at a record high level, a level he also reached nearly five years ago. His approval on the economy and inflation have dropped below 50 percent but he maintains strong support for his border security policies, according to most Americans surveyed in our poll. It comes as the president faces legal opposition to part of his immigration agenda. White House officials say President Trump has the clear authority to deport Venezuelan migrants suspected of being gang members. Senior White House Correspondent Jacqui Heinrich tells us live from the north law on what's next in this legal fight. Also some new info about the UkraineRussia negotiations. Good evening, Jacqui. JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. Moments ago, Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy, Stephen Miller told reporters that President Trump still wants to see Judge James Boasberg impeached, despite pushback from Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who said the appeals process, not impeachment, is the appropriate response. Tonight, the court fight over the wartime law deportations continues. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KAROLINE LEAVITT, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: It's incumbent upon the Supreme Court to rein in these activist judges. HEINRICH (voice over): Judge James Boasberg giving the White House another day to provide specific information on the movements of two deportation flights Saturday as part of his probe into whether the government purposely flouted his orders blocking it, and if so, what the punishment should be. DOJ lawyers have repeatedly said, the flights were outside U.S. airspace when both the verbal and written orders came down. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I never did defy a court order. LAURA INGLE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: And you wouldn't in the future? TRUMP: No, you can't do that. However, we have bad judges. At a certain point, you have to start looking at, what do you do when you have a rogue judge? HEINRICH (voice over): Right now, the administration is not barred from using the Alien Enemies Act for deportations, but it's supposed to notify the court first. A ruling on the merits, still pending, the White House says there's a concerted effort from the far left to judge shop. HEINRICH: What option does he have to ensure that his agenda continues to move forward while this is ongoing and the judges appear to be trying to just block and delay and repeat? LEAVITT: We will continue to use the full weight of the White House Counsel's Office and the president's team of lawyers to fight this in court, because we know we will win, even if we have to go all the way to the Supreme Court. HEINRICH (voice over): Meantime, positive readouts from the White House and Ukraine moving toward implementing a partial cease fire, protecting energy infrastructure. Zelenskyy highlighting Russian strikes overnight on the power grid. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think everybody has to calm down a bit. Cease fires are a little bit messy at the start. HEINRICH (voice over): The White House says Zelenskyy asked for more patriot missile systems. President Trump agreed to find what's available, particularly in Europe, officials also emphatic there was no discussion on any calls about suspending military aid or intelligence sharing, despite repeated claims from the Kremlin that Putin asked for it. Officials here say all aid and intel sharing is continuing. (END VIDEOTAPE) HEINRICH (on camera): We are also learning tonight, the president reportedly warned Iran of consequences if the Ayatollah did not accept his offer for new talks on its nuclear deal. The president's letter, according to Axios, imposed a two-month deadline to reach a new deal. It is not clear if that clock starts right now, but this week, Iran said it's drafting a response to the president despite the Supreme Leader's initial rejection of it, Bret. BAIER: Jacqui Heinrich live in the North Lawn. Jacqui, thank you. President Trump says his agenda will not be hindered long term, despite legal rulings that block several of his executive actions, recent decisions have targeted the Trump administration's effort to bar transgender people from serving openly in the military. The DOGE efforts, as well as funding and grant cuts. Correspondent Griff Jenkins explains how the Trump administration plans to appeal. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): In a heated court battle, Obama appointed District Court Judge Beryl Howell declined to have DOGE kicked out of the U.S. Institute of Peace, a congressionally created independent think tank, despite her concerns over how Elon Musk's team has treated fired staffers and gained access to the building, notching a win for Team Trump. After a slew of rulings have paused the president's initiatives. U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes, a Biden appointee, blocked Trump's executive order barring transgender people from openly serving in the military, calling it unconstitutional. Writing, the cruel irony is that thousands of transgender service members have sacrificed, some risking their lives to ensure for others the very equal protection rights the military ban seeks to deny them. Reyes is facing a misconduct complaint filed by the Justice Department over aggressive questioning of government lawyers in this case, and has a history of activism in the Democratic Party. Her order is delayed from taking effect until Friday, giving the Trump administration time to appeal. Federal Judge Theodore Chuang, also an Obama appointee, will the Trump administration likely violated the Constitution in dismantling USAID. TRUMP: I guarantee you, we will be appealing it. We have rogue judges that are destroying our country. JENKINS (voice over): And federal judge Tanya Chutkan, another Obama appointee who oversaw one of Trump's election interference criminal cases temporarily halted the EPA's attempt to recoup $20 billion in Biden era climate grants. The White House remains undeterred, critical of these judges. LEAVITT: They are trying to block delay in MP. This is law fare. (END VIDEOTAPE) JENKINS (on camera): And consider, Bret, since 1963 there have been a total of 127 court orders pausing presidential initiatives, 12 under Obama's first two terms or two terms, 64 in Trump's first term, 14 under Biden and now 15 against Trump in February alone, Bret. BAIER: Griff, thank you. Now, to news overseas, Israeli troops have taken to the ground and sky in attacks on Gaza, new attacks following the collapse of that cease fire deal with Hamas. It comes as many in the country appear in opposition of Israel's renewed attacks and amid fears over the fate of the remaining hostages. Chief Foreign Affairs Chief foreign correspondent Trey Yingst reports from Tel Aviv. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TREY YINGST, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Thousands of protesters gather in Jerusalem to demonstrate against the Israeli government. They're calling for a return to the cease fire and the protection of the Shin Bet intelligence chief. Prime Minister Netanyahu plans to fire him over disagreements about who is responsible for the failure in intelligence that led to the October 7th attack. SHIMRIT MAROM, PROTESTER: I want the hostages back. I don't want the war to restart. I think our government is not doing what it should in the interests of the people, but it's self-serving. YINGST (voice over): Less than 50 miles away, the Israeli Air Force continues to pummel the Gaza Strip with air strikes as the war intensifies. Wednesday afternoon, the Israeli military announced that ground forces have now entered Gaza and are recapturing territory in what is being described as a limited operation. Israel's Defense Minister Israel Katz, says more evacuation orders will soon be issued for Palestinian civilians as the military campaign expands and Israel reclaims part of the strategic Netzarim supply corridor. ISRAEL KATZ, ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator): If all the Israeli hostages are not released and Hamas is not expelled from Gaza, Israel will act with an intensity that you have not seen. YINGST (voice over): Palestinian civilians are continuing to bury the dead killed by Israeli bombs, while regional leaders like Jordan's King Abdullah are condemning the return to war. ABDULLAH II, JORDANIAN KING: Israel's attacks and its blockade of aid, water and electricity to Gaza are escalatory measures that risk the lives of a severely vulnerable population. The cease fire must be restored, and the flow of aid must resume immediately. (END VIDEOTAPE) YINGST (on camera): Israeli officials continue to coordinate with the Trump administration over the war in Gaza, though no diplomatic breakthroughs are expected in the days ahead, Bret. BAIER: Trey Yingst in Tel Aviv. Trey, thanks. Back here in the U.S., the Federal Reserve saying the economy still looks healthy enough to keep interest rates unchanged. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledging rising pessimism among U.S. consumers in recent surveys, but said the economy is solid at the moment. Stocks took that news. They were up on that news. The Dow gaining 383, the S&P 500 rose 61, the NASDAQ was up 247. Voters are expressing doubt about President Trump's tariffs according to our new Fox News polls, a majority think tariffs will hurt the U.S. economy. 47 percent also think inflation is not under control, while just four percent believe rising prices are completely under control. Up next, we will speak with Energy Secretary Chris Wright about President Trump's effort to unleash American energy. First, here's what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. Fox 32 in Chicago, as an Illinois committee gives initial approval to a controversial home schooling bill. The legislation establishes requirements for parents to meet when home schooling their children. Parents against that bill call it overreach. The legislation is expected to head to the House floor for a vote next week. Fox 11 in Los Angeles, where federal authorities are searching for a prominent Los Angeles music executive who say -- they say used industry connections with a street gang to run a vast mafia like organization. Officials are searching for Eugene Henley, also known as Big U, who worked with hip hop artists. Court documents show Henley has been a long time figure in the rolling '60s neighborhood, Crips street gang, which has been linked to extortion, human trafficking and murder. And this is a live look from New York in Fox 5. One of the big stories there tonight, the Trump administration is threatening to cut federal funding for the city's public transit, demanding New York hand over subway crime data. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy requesting statistics on assaults and fare evasion from the last two years. Metropolitan Transit Authority officials say it is already discussing crime fighting efforts. That's tonight's live look outside the Beltway from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LEAVITT: President Trump's laser focus on massive deregulation and unleashing our domestic energy industry is leading to stability for Americans' bottom lines. REP. KATHY CASTOR (D-FL): We cannot be an energy dominant nation without solar, without wind, without energy efficiency. That is what is going to power our future, not giving handouts to big oil. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Well, President Trump met with oil and gas executives today at the White House. Energy Secretary Chris Wright was at that meeting. He joins us now from the North Lawn to discuss the president's energy agenda. Mr. Secretary, thanks for the time. What do you take from that meeting today? CHRIS WRIGHT, U.S. SECRETARY OF ENERGY: Well, first thing I learned was it's the first time in over four years that anyone in the oil and gas industry has even been in the White House. They were persona non grata before, and I think what they were looking for was just a business climate that they can invest, keep growing American oil and natural gas production to drive our domestic prices down and have this ever growing exports from our country, helps our economy, helps our allies, helps our balance of trade. BAIER: You know, you have oil prices dropping if you look at the chart from January 17th to March now, it's about $67.00, 14 percent decrease. If you look over the chart over the past six months, you can see the dramatic drop. Gas prices have been coming down, down from 349, one year ago. You know, the question is, for some of these companies, the lower prices are somewhat incompatible with increased production, or at least they talk like that. Did they raise that issue? What is the price you're looking to go for oil and, for that matter, gas? WRIGHT: In the long constructive dialog we had, we never discussed oil prices. Those are set by supply and demand. Same thing with natural gas. Nobody decides the price of oil or the price of natural gas. But if you make it harder to produce them, you put obstructions in the way and investment risks, as the last administration does, you're necessarily going to get less of them. You don't change the demand, you get higher prices. So, you've seen prices move down already, Bret, and that's because the marketplace sees it's going to be a lot easier to produce oil and gas in the United States now. We're going to have investments in pipelines and infrastructure to export and move it to consumers. That's going to drive prices down, the markets discounting that already. BAIER: You've called for spending $20 billion to refill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for Oil the SPRO. Many experts wonder whether that's a vital national security asset or an expensive government interference in the free markets, as you're talking about. What are the plans for the SPRO? Are you going to refill that thing? WRIGHT: Absolutely, you know, we built the SPRO, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We don't know what happens on a very bad day. If we have a cataclysm globally and we cut off supply of oil products from either our own fields or trading partners overseas, you need to have that in store for that bad day. It's not for market manipulation. It's not to win the midterm elections in 2022 as it was used for irresponsibly drained more than had ever been in the history to its lowest level since it was constructed today. So, it will take us time and effort, and it won't be market moving, but yes, we should build our Strategic Petroleum Reserve back up, because that's what it takes to keep the American people safe and secure. BAIER: Well, are you looking for a number to start that process? Because at $67.00 a barrel, it's obviously down a lot from the 121 in the Biden administration. WRIGHT: Yes, it looks -- it looks to be an attractive time to be buying oil, but you can't fill the reserve nearly as fast as you can drain it. That's another degree of that irresponsibility. It will be years to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve back up. For tweaking the outcomes of an election, we're going to have years of reduced capacity of oil storage, but we'll fill it. But it will take time, Bret, it takes time. BAIER: The build out of America data centers is a big deal. It's going to increase energy demand, some say by 15 percent by 2030. Can America meet that demand? WRIGHT: Not only can we meet that demand, we must meet that demand. This is -- I liken it to the Manhattan Project, where we had to build an atomic bomb before Nazi Germany, China is going all out on A.I., and it has massive national security implications, as well as the business productivity and consumer products we love so much. It has massive national security implications, we need to stay ahead in the arms race. And you're right. It takes a lot of energy to power A.I., but America is an energy power house. We're the biggest producer of oil and natural gas in the world by far. Can we grow that? The biggest challenge is going to be building the electrical grid and the electric production infrastructure, not oil and gas production, but electricity production. We went backwards on that for four years. Electricity prices went up massively during the Biden administration, without any meaningful growth in production capacity. We need to go the other direction. Now, we got to add a lot of production capacity, stop the rise of prices and ultimately bring electricity prices back down. It's a challenge, but the Trump administration is up for -- is up for the challenge. BAIER: Yes. So, the Biden administration also halted exports of liquid natural gas. Today, you signed this approval for a new export terminal. Huge growth for LNG. I'm wondering what you see in that market as far as exporting LNG across the world? WRIGHT: Look, the fastest growing energy source on the planet over the last 15 years is natural gas that the planet is increasingly getting powered by natural gas, and it's the second largest U.S. export after oil and oil products, and it's our fastest growing export. So, it's tremendously positive for the U.S. economy. And boy, what I discussed -- what I released earlier today, was the previous administration had a report that they had produced that showed increased LNG exports would have negligible price impact on domestic gas prices and would reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They didn't like that answer. They buried the study, and then they made a new study, very carefully tailored to support their agenda, and it didn't even really support their agenda. But those days of pseudoscience and frankly, outright deception, those are over. The Trump administration is about math, about data and about the American people. It is a dramatic turnaround. This story is unbelievable (INAUDIBLE). BAIER: So, you found that study? WRIGHT: We found that study. BAIER: You found that study and you said that they buried it because it made it -- it was too good for liquid natural gas exports? WRIGHT: They buried the study. Claimed it didn't exist. It was subpoenaed by Congress to get it, and we were able to recover this study. The study ultimately released over a year later, has the exact same title, the exact same agenda. It just removed a lot of the pages and data that got the wrong conclusion. They changed some assumptions around, made up some fictitious scenarios to sort of support their agenda. But that's just shameless. Natural gas is not just our fastest growing export. When we have crises or shortages in natural gas, Pakistan shut their schools down because that's how they power their busses. India stops fertilizer production. Europe is at threat of heating and electricity prices. You can't mess with energy for political reasons. This is just critical to the American people. BAIER: Let me just ask you two quick foreign policy things. Today, President Trump, according to Secretary Rubio and the National Security Adviser Waltz, discussed Ukraine's electric supply and nuclear power plants, saying that the United States could be very helpful in running those plants and American ownership of those plants. So, he wants to run -- the U.S. to run or own nuclear power plants in Ukraine. How would that work, and would that require U.S. boots on the ground? Or how would that work? WRIGHT: Certainly, we have immense technical expertise in the United States to run those plans. I don't think that requires boots on the ground, but I'll leave the foreign policy to President Trump and Secretary Rubio. I know they are working tirelessly. How do we bring peace to Ukraine? How do we get this fighting to stop, which takes both sides to lay down their arms. But if it was helpful to achieve that end, have the U.S. run nuclear power plants in Ukraine. No problem. We can do that. BAIER: Last thing. Last April, Congress passed a new Iran Sanctions law called the SHIP act, targeting ports that harbor sanctioned Iranian tankers. Experts said it could bring a new level of maximum pressure against Iranian oil, but the Biden administration didn't ever roll that out. Are you -- are you going to do that? WRIGHT: Oh, the Trump in his first administration, President Trump, did exactly that. You're right. Iranian exports dropped by 75 percent, huge financial squeeze on them. Stop significant money flowing to terrorists and saved a lot of lives around the world. Can that be done again? Absolutely, absolutely that can be done. And if that foreign policy decision is made that to do that, it can be executed swiftly. BAIER: And if there are sanctions on Iran, sanctions on Russia that affect oil, U.S. production can make up the difference. You believe? WRIGHT: I believe so. Absolutely. We've got pretty loose oil markets right now. There's some spare capacity in the Middle East as well. And U.S. production can grow. So, I think we have great foreign policy flexibility right now. That's the importance of American energy dominance, not only helps our domestic economy, gives us great geopolitical leverage. BAIER: Mr. Secretary, we really appreciate the time and you're welcome back anytime. WRIGHT: Thanks for having me, Bret. BAIER: Up next, a North Dakota jury finds Greenpeace liable for damages in the Dakota Access Pipeline case. We'll tell you how much they've been ordered to pay. And then we dig into the latest batch of newly released documents on the assassination of John F. Kennedy. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Breaking tonight, the man who was believed to be the last person to see a missing Pittsburgh student alive is on route to Puerto Rico at this hour. That's according to a FOX News report according to correspondent Bryan Llenas. A judge ordered Joshua Riibe to be released yesterday. He was being held in connection to the disappearance of Sudiksha Konanki in the Dominican Republic but had not been named a suspect. Konanki's parents say authorities believe she drowned. Meantime, Greenpeace has been ordered to pay hundreds of millions of dollars over its Dakota Access pipeline protest. A North Dakota jury found the organization liable for defamation and other claims brought by the pipeline company. National correspondent William La Jeunesse reports on the legal battle that dates back almost 10 years now. Good evening, William. WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. You know, it's not just a crippling judgment against the world's best known environmental groups, but many progressive organizations fear this will damage their ability to fight big oil and other corporate projects. So as 2017 protests grew violent then when demonstrators clashed with police over an oil pipeline under the Missouri River. President Obama had stopped it. President Trump revived it, restarting construction of a 1,200-mile pipeline carrying crude from North Dakota to Midwest refineries. Activists, however, did not back down. Greenpeace, according to the pipeline's lawsuit, orchestrated a campaign to stop construction, providing intelligence, training, tents, tools, and lockboxes that protesters used to chain themselves to equipment, leading to some 700 arrests. Now the company, Energy Transfer, claims Greenpeace also defamed it, causing banks to divest, costing it some $300 million in damages. ""Greenpeace took a small, disorganized local issue and exploited it to shut down the Dakota Access pipeline and promote its own selfish agenda,"" said Attorney Trey Cox in closing arguments. 'They thought they'd never get caught."" Now the judgment could, again, have impact not just on Greenpeace but other groups that use social media, daring protests, and press attention to drive public opinion. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DEEPA PADMANABHA, GREENPEACE USA SENIOR LEGAL ADVISOR: This is a really critical time to people to step in exercising our First Amendment rights. This is to scare us. And in this moment where it's likely that other corporations are trying to see, oh, will this have the intended chilling effect? (END VIDEO CLIP) LA JEUNESSE: So the judgment is $660 million. It's an amount that Greenpeace said could shut down operations. It plans to appeal here and in the Netherlands where it is based internationally. Bret? BAIER: William, thank you. Attorney General Pam Bondi is reacting to recent attacks on Tesla vehicles, saying the Justice Department has charged multiple people and more legal actions are coming. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PAM BONDI, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: We believe these are organized. These are not individuals out there throughout the country doing this on their own. They are targeting Tesla owners, they are targeting Tesla dealerships. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Meanwhile, former Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz says he checks Tesla's stock when he needs a boost. The stock has been on the decline since November. According to Minnesota's state board of investment, that state has $1.8 million shares of Tesla as of June 30th, 2024, in state funds. The Vancouver International Auto Show has removed Tesla from its event this week over safety concerns. The event's executive director says Tesla had opportunities to voluntarily withdraw. Meantime, we are sorting through new documents, thousands of them relating to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. It will likely take several days to go through the nearly 80,000 files. Correspondent David Spunt has been looking through the documents and gives us some of the highlights. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: The document dump extensive. Some pages look like this, while others look like this, copies of copies of copies. Many of the documents focus on CIA operations relating to Cuba. In June, 1961, two years before the assassination, Arthur Schlesinger, a close adviser to President Kennedy, warned the CIA was gaining too much power. He wrote to the president, ""The contemporary CIA possesses many of the characteristics of a state within a state. Files upon files focus on Lee Harvey Oswald, the man the Warren Commission concluded to be the lone gunman and person responsible for the murder. Oswald had connections to both Cuba and the Soviet Union where he once lived. A former CIA officer recalled the, quote, ""unusual behavior"" of Oswald. Also included, a previously released story of former military analyst and magazine photographer Gary Underhill who reportedly told a friend he believed a small group within the CIA was behind the president's murder, and he was afraid for his life and probably would have to leave the country. Underhill was found dead in 1964. The official cause, suicide. Larry Sabato is a professor at the University of Virginia and has studied in detail the Kennedy assassination for decades. LARRY SABATO, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA: There's simply, in my guess, not going to be any document that says we believe that in addition to Lee Harvey Oswald it was x, y, or z. Or we believe Oswald was controlled some silo group in the CIA. You're not going to find that. (END VIDEO TAPE) SPUNT: Officials, Bret, say 99 percent of the Kennedy documents have been made public, but sources tell FOX News the remaining documents have been held back to protect identities and investigative methods. Bret? BAIER: We'll keep digging. David, thank you. Up next, we speak with the president of the Democratic Republic of Congo about violence in central Africa and a possible minerals deal with the U.S. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Welcome back to SPECIAL REPORT. In just a few moments, we will speak with the president of the Democratic Republic of Congo. But first, let's take a look at the history of the conflict in his country. This region has been ravaged by war over religion, ethnicity, and minerals since the 1990s. More than 6 million people have died. Now, the first conflict began amid the 1994 Rwandan genocide. That's when the Hutu extremists in Rwanda killed an estimated 1 million Tutsis and moderate Hutus, other groups. At the same time, around 2 million Hutu refugees crossed into the Democratic Republic of Congo, settling in the eastern region. This is in the red part here. Small portion were extremists who began organizing militias, prompting the Tutsis to do the same. Now, sporadic fighting would take place all in the early 2000 when peace agreements were being negotiated. But that would bring the emergence of another group, M23. In 2012, the group took the strategic city of Goma, right here in the middle. They pulled out days later due to international pressure and fled to Uganda and Rwanda. M23 then resurfaced in 2021 with an estimated 6,500 fighters that began to take significant control of the territory in that region. They shelled displacement camps, they cut off supply routes. Congo is considered the world's richest country in terms of natural resources. Untapped deposits are worth, get this, an estimated $24 trillion, with a ""t."" The country also produces 68 percent of the world's cobalt. It's the fourth largest producer of diamonds in the world. Lithium deposits are also significant. Now, China controls much of Congo's mining industry and has given Congo's government drones and weaponry to defend those mines. Other countries also have an interest in the region. Burundi, a majority Hutu country, sees Rwanda as a threat and it supports the Congolese troops. Uganda is defending against Islamic state linked militants along its borders. They've targeted religious groups in the Congo as well. Also, South Africa recently announcing a phased withdrawal of thousands of troops from eastern Congo after several peacekeepers were killed by rebels. While M23 leaders withdrew from peace talks this week with the Congo, President Tshisekedi met with his Rwandan counterpart this week for talks mediated by Qatar. The countries agreed to continue discussions to establish lasting peace in the region. It comes as the U.S. considers minerals deal with the government in exchange for security assistance. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TAMMY BRUCE, STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESWOMAN: I can tell you we stand in firm support of the Congolese people and of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the DRC. We remain diplomatically engaged. (END VIDEO CLIP) (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) BAIER: We are joined by Felix Tshisekedi, president of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Mr. President, thank you for being here. I want to start with this. The Trump administration is interested in securing exclusive mineral deals with countries rich in rare earth minerals. We saw that obviously with Ukraine. Can you talk about discussions for a deal with your country? FELIX TSHISEKEDI, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO PRESIDENT (through translator): Thank you very much, good evening to you. We are looking for partnerships, and we have established partnerships with many other countries. And we think the United States of America, given its role and influence around the world, is an important partner to have. And we are very happy to see that with the Trump administration, things are moving a lot faster on both sides. BAIER: Untapped deposits are worth an estimated $24 trillion. What would you need to happen to move forward with that relationship. TSHISEKEDI: We want to extract these minerals but also process them as this would create a lot of jobs. And we want a partnership that will provide lasting peace and stability for our countries, which we need. BAIER: It's a dangerous place, the Congo. How would a U.S. company guarantee safety on the ground? TSHISEKEDI: We can build our defense and security capabilities, and I think that the U.S. is able to use either pressure or sanctions to make sure that armed groups who are in the DRC can be kept at bay. BAIER: Mr. President, the United States has been concerned about China's influence in Africa, particularly in the DRC. How would you manage this relationship with Beijing while maintaining ties with the U.S. that you obviously want to expand? TSHISEKEDI: Nature abhors a vacuum, as the saying goes. It's not that ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 it's more that America is waning in Africa. And we would be very happy to have our American friends here who used to be more present than China in the 70s and 80s. BAIER: How do you think minerals deal, if it comes to fruition, would benefit Americans? TSHISEKEDI: Silicon Valley companies know exactly what I mean. And so I think this partnership will help these industries develop more and more innovative products. BAIER: I want you to address, if you could, and talk about the fighting in eastern DRC and how do you intend to resolve it. TSHISEKEDI: The DRC has the neighboring country called Rwanda, which about 30 years ago experienced a genocide. The international community at the time asked us to open our borders to receive droves of refugees who were fleeing the fighting and the massacres. And since then, unfortunately, this hellish situation that was in Rwanda at the time has seeped into the Democratic Republic of the Congo. That is why we insist on having sanctions. BAIER: Last thing, Mr. President. It has been 50 years since one of the greatest sporting events involving U.S. athletes, the Rumble in the Jungle. It took place in your capital, Kinshasa, 1 billion people watched Muhammed Ali, expected to lose, defeat George Foreman in that fight. Can you talk about the legacy of that fight for your country and the United States? TSHISEKEDI: Yes, of course. We still remember. This event really galvanized the people and had everybody's attention. They were training here, and every time they went somewhere, people knew about it. So we really experienced a boom thanks to that, this historic fight that really put our country on the map. We really have a lot to give and all we ask is really for an opportunity to live in peace. BAIER: Mr. President, we appreciate the time, and we look forward to following all news out of the Congo and the DRC, and we'll follow this relationship with you and the U.S. Thank you very much, sir. TSHISEKEDI: Thank you very much, Mr. Baier. Thank you. (END VIDEO TAPE) BAIER: Up next, the panel on our latest FOX polls, also how the Trump administration plans to counter legal challenges to its immigration initiatives. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: You have local judges, local federal judges, local judges, period, and D.A.s and prosecutors, D.A.s, state attorney generals, attorney generals, that want to really take over. I think some of it's for the publicity. KAROLINE LEAVITT, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The judges in this country are acting erroneously. They are trying to clearly slow-walk this administration's agenda. STEPHEN BREYER, FORMER SUPREME COURT JUSTICE: The best thing I think for the judges is you follow the law. You simply follow the law. And that is what they try to do. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: This is a big deal, the legal cases," the judge's orders versus the Trump administration. The Trump legal headwinds are all over the headlines. """"Judge warns of consequences if Trump administration violated deportation order."""" """"Federal judge blocks Trump's transgender military executive order."""" """"Trump administration ramps up rhetoric targeting the courts amid mounting legal setbacks."""" With that", let's bring in our panel, Matthew Continetti, scholar at the American Enterprise Institute," """"Axios"""" political reporter Stef Kight", and FOX News chief political analyst Brit Hume. Brit, what do you make of this back-and-forth? We've heard legal arguments on all sides about this, and where the Trump administration stands tonight on this. BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I think that the Trump administration may lose this case. It has to do with the transporting of those gang members outside the country. But I think it will win on a bunch of others. I also think this, Bret, that one of the problems here is that these federal judges who have supposedly limited jurisdiction, limited in no small part by the cases before them, issue these nationwide injunctions whose effects reach far beyond the parties before them in these cases. And the Supreme Court has never spoken on this, although two current justices have suggested they think it's illegitimate to do that. If they rein that in, that will go a long way to cooling things down, I think. BAIER: Mark Levin, Matthew, took to X saying," """"Sorry", judge," but your oral directive is insufficient says the precedent in your own federal district. I should know as Landmark Legal Foundation litigated a 2003 case against the EPA that underscores the requirement for a written order."""" He said more on """"THE STORY"""" with Martha. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARK LEVIN", RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: You don't just sit at the bench and say, you know, you ought to stop doing this and stop doing that. It doesn't necessarily get to everybody, certainly not in a timely way. He figured it out. It was a little late. It's only been the custom practice and tradition in that courtroom for at least 23 years when I litigated this case, which is put your damn order in writing, judge, so the people you are bullying around or ordering around know exactly what you are doing. It's called giving them notice. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: So that's the specifics, in his view, on this case, Matthew. But broadly, the separation of powers and how much power a district judge has on this issue is really the bigger issue. CONTINETTI: Yes, absolutely. And as Brit says, these district judges are overreaching. I have a rule, Bret, always defer to the great one. So I'm going to talk about the political angle here, and that is judicial activism of the sort we are seeing from these district judges I believe is going to prove very unpopular. When you look at that new FOX poll that came out today, immigration is Trump's strongest issue and it's driving his popularity at the highest level in the FOX poll. So, he is operating from a position of strength here. And I think the voters are given a lot of leeway as these cases make their way through the legal system. BAIER: In an interview with Laura Ingraham, Stef, this is what the president said about those orders. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: Are there circumstances where you would defy a court order? DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: Well, I think that, number one, nobody has been through more courts than I have. I think nobody knows the courts any better than I have. I would say the chief judge does, but nobody knows them better than I have. And what they have done to me, I've had the worst judges. I've had crooked judges. INGRAHAM: Going forward, would you defy a court order? TRUMP: I had judges that were so corrupt -- INGRAHAM: We all know that -- TRUMP: I never did defy a court order. INGRAHAM: And you wouldn't in the future? TRUMP: No, you can't do that. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Stef, your take on all this? STEF KIGHT, POLITICAL REPORTER," """"AXIOS"""": One thing to remember is that a judge stopping an executive action is not a new phenomenon. It has been a frustration for presidents on both sides of the aisle", especially in the immigration space. But how this plays out, whether we see any ramifications for the Trump administration deciding to ignore what the judge asked them to do in turning around those planes, deporting Venezuelans, that's going to be a key area to watch and something a lot of people have been waiting to see, whether Trump would be willing to move forward and ignore a court order. BAIER: He says he won't. Brit, and you buy it? HUME: Well, I think that it's worth noting that the administration, having left those planes in the air and they went and landed down El Salvador, has argued strenuously to the judge that it did not violate the order. And the president says over and over again they won't do that, so I suspect they will not. BAIER: There you go. Panel, thanks so much. We squeezed a lot in tonight. Tomorrow on SPECIAL REPORT, Education Secretary Linda McMahon joins us to discuss the developing story the president plans to sign the executive order to close the department she leads. We're going to cover all things. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. Got a lot in. That's it for this SPECIAL REPORT, fair, balanced," and still unafraid.

"Interview with Brendan Carr, FCC Chair",2025-02-06T00:00:00Z,Brian Kilmeade,"FOX AND FRIENDS 6:00 AM EST Brendan Carr Fox News, FOX AND FRIENDS6:00 AM EST, NEWS; International, 725words",U.S. Federal,"BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: FCC Chair, Brendan Carr joins us now, he's running that probe. Concerning to you, Brendan? BRENDAN CARR, FCC CHAIR: Yeah, of course. Look, I try to look on the bright side of things, and here, I think that's the fact that we are having an unprecedented number of deportations taking place in this country. And for that, thank goodness for President Trump. Promises made, promises kept. He came in and said he's the person that can not only secure the border, but deport people that are here illegally, and he's carrying that out with unprecedented speed. Thanks to Secretary Noem, Tom Homan as well. Here, this is really concerning. So what happened was you had ICE agents, undercover, doing operations in east San Jose, in part of the town known for violent gang activity, and you had this radio station broadcasting the live location, identifying the unmarked vehicles that they were in, and again, against the backdrop of Democrat leaders in Congress saying, it's time for people to take fights to the street against Trump's agenda. So we have sent a letter of inquiry, a formal investigation into that matter, and they have just a matter of days left to respond to that inquiry and explain how this could possibly be consistent with their public interest obligations. KILMEADE: And I should have called you chairman. I apologize for that. In terms of USAID funding, and people are concerned about the spending here, if you want to know motivation, look at this, $377,000 from USAID workers go to Democrats, 12 go to Republicans, and you wonder if there's a political agenda there. At the very least, you have to understand -- you have to understand the concern. CARR: Yeah, look, when you look at USAID in particular, it has been operating as sort of a money laundering operation for all sorts of radical causes, everything from promoting divisive DEI to actually helping to fund some of the censorship cartel operations that are taking place across the board. So it's very interesting that this is the place where Democrats have decided to go to the ramparts. KILMEADE: All right, and by the way, we reached out to Odyssey (ph) to get a statement on this. George Soros bought all those stations. You dissented from it, but now you're in charge. Who knows if that would have went through if you were in charge? Meanwhile, the other big story is 60 Minutes. And you said you have to turn over the transcripts of the Vice President Kamala Harris' interview because of the way obviously it was edited and they're already being sued for $10 billion by the Trump team. Are you worried about the precedent of asking for these transcripts because now everybody that has to edit down an interview with a high-profile figure will have the same situation? CARR: No, not at all. What's actually interesting here is the precedent we're following is the precedent that the Democrat FCC set when it came to ""Fox."" There was a complaint lodged against ""Fox"" and so they opened up a public proceeding on that and we're simply applying that precedent. You know, look, there's a lot of people in this country right now on the radical left that are upset about this investigation into ""CBS"" and the work that I'm doing on broadcasters. And to sort of paraphrase Thomas Sowell, when the government has been weaponized in your favor, it feels like discrimination when all of a sudden there's even-handed treatment. There's a lot of people that have been on sort of that upper road of the two-tiered system of government. And what I'm here to do is apply the law evenly. This is a rare situation where we have extrinsic evidence that CBS had played one answer or one set of words and then swapped in another set. And CBS's conduct through this, frankly, has been concerning. You know, look, they just did an interview with Vice President Vance and immediately fully disclosed the unedited transcript. For some reason, they decided not to do that in this case. And so we've now opened a proceeding. We think it's in the public interest to allow people to participate and comment. And we're going to take this one step at a time at the FCC. KILMEADE: And hopefully we can talk to you pretty consistently, Chairman, because there's so much going on in media that really matters, and it's changing so quickly. Brendan Carr, thanks so much. CARR: Thanks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: You know, Jesse, the Aardvark was a lot. WATTERS: I'm sorry. BAIER: All right, thank you. Good evening. I'm Bret Baier. The Elon Musk downloads on DOGE. He talks exclusively with Fox Business's Larry Kudlow. Larry joins us here. There is now an app for illegal immigrants who want to get in line for legal immigration. And the Afghan terror suspect charged in the deadly Kabul airport suicide bombing appears in court. But first breaking tonight, growing fears of a recession and a possible protracted trade war brought on by tariffs sent the U.S. stock market to one of its worst days in years. The Dow was down more than 1,100 today, before ending with a loss of 890. The S&P 500 sank 156, the NASDAQ plunged 728. President Trump is not ruling out a recession as his tariffs take effect, but he says the U.S. economy will be stronger in the long run. Senior White House Correspondent Jacqui Heinrich starts us off tonight live from the North Lawn. Good evening, Jacqui. JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. We haven't seen the president today, a round table with tech CEOs stayed closed to press, and he's been pretty quiet online, but a White House official said the market downturn diverges from what they're seeing from business leaders, and that that more meaningfully reflects what's in store in the medium to long term. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HEINRICH (voice over): Not a no the first time he was asked. MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Are you expecting a recession this year? DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I hate to predict things like that. HEINRICH (voice over): Or the second time. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you worried about a recession? Maria Bartiromo asked you and you kind of hesitated. TRUMP: I'll tell you what. Of course, you hesitate. Who knows? All I know is this, we're going to take in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs, and we're going to become so rich, you're not going to know where to spend all that money. HEINRICH (voice over): Despite this take from the Commerce Secretary. HOWARD LUTNICK, U.S. COMMERCE SECRETARY: There's going to be no recession in America. HEINRICH (voice over): The president's remarks sent stocks sliding Monday as recession concerns grew. It followed last week's Wall Street volatility after 25 percent tariffs on Mexico and Canada were green lit then partially paused for another month. Ontario responded with a 25 percent surcharge on electricity exports. Republicans holding out some hope for cooperation with the next prime minister after Mark Carney won the liberal party's election to replace Justin Trudeau. REP. TOM EMMER (R-MN): I think the Canadians are going to recognize it's better to be friends and treat each other the way we would want to be treated, rather than to do this nonsense that they're rattling the saber with. HEINRICH (voice over): But there's less clarity for Mexico. STEVE FORBES, FORBES MEDIA CHAIRMAN: That's part of the problem. What are the rules? What are the metrics? I mean, the president of Mexico put her life on the line when she sent some of those drug lords back here to the United States. So, what do we expect more from Mexico? HEINRICH (voice over): So far, the president has dismissed concerns from CEOs. Meanwhile, Beijing implemented retaliatory tariffs on U.S. farm products. Democrats accused the president of being apathetic. REP. RO KHANNA (D-CA): You've got unemployment that's ticking up. You've got inflation ticking up. Consumer confidence is down. The Trump team is calling those short term adjustments, that's concerning. HEINRICH (voice over): As investors worry unpredictable tariff policies are hurtling toward a full blown trade war, Elon Musk is also dismissing criticism over DOGE. ELON MUSK, CEO, TESLA MOTORS: When we get criticism, we say, like, of what? Which line do you disagree with? Like, which cut -- which cut, which cost saving do you disagree with? And people usually can't think of any. (END VIDEOTAPE) HEINRICH (on camera): One area that could see progress this week is the Russia-Ukraine war. Envoy Steve Witkoff reportedly heading to Moscow at some point to meet with Putin. Tomorrow, he will be joining Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Adviser Mike Waltz for talks with the Ukrainians in Saudi Arabia, Bret. BAIER: Jacqui, thank you. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: I'm telling you, you just watch. We're going to have jobs, we're going to have open factories. It's going to be great. KEVIN HASSETT, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR: The trade policy uncertainty is the one thing that people will see, and that is going to be resolved in early April. When that happens, then the economy really lifts off. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: President Trump talking about fears of a recession, at least answering questions about that. It has been a bumpy ride on the market in the past few days. Larry Kudlow of Fox Business joins us now. He has just finished a live interview with Elon Musk, and he's here to talk about that. Larry, good afternoon. I want to talk about that. I want to talk about your interview, but I also want to talk about what we've seen on the markets and in the U.S. economy. If you look at it from just today, it was a roller coaster ride, mostly down, and then over the past couple of days. And then, if you go backwards all the way to the beginning of the inauguration, there was, you know, down about 1500 points. It's a correction. It happens. But it's tough for some investors to look at. LARRY KUDLOW, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Well, it is in full correction mode, which is 10 percent, a full bear market I guess is 20 percent, I wouldn't want to predict any of it. It's interesting to me. I hear this talk about recession, I don't see -- I mean, profits are rising, and that's not an indicator of recession. And actually, the manufacturing and services surveys are showing above 50 percent and the jobs report on Friday wasn't fabulous, but it was pretty solid. So, I'm not -- really, I don't think there's a strong recession case to be made. There are weaknesses in the economy, no question about that. But I don't know. I'm a little skeptical about the recession scenario. And then again, you know, stocks correct when they correct, Bret. I mean, that's the beauty of the stock market. BAIER: That is the beauty of that. Elon Musk, obviously, is doing a lot with DOGE, working with each one of these agencies. What was your take away from your interview? KUDLOW: Well, it was quite interesting. I mean, you know, he talked about how he chooses, he goes in, they're in all the agencies now, I'm not sure I knew that. He's got a hundred people on his team. He wants to build it out to 200 people. He's going to be around for quite a while. As you know, the president just backed him again this weekend. But I thought the most interesting thing is, he said, I think he's heard a calling. I asked him, I said, did you hear a call for action? And he started talking about how, you know, the deficits have been bad, and the debt is a big burden, and the interest expense is a big burden, and he's quite concerned about the politics of that and how that could damage the country. I just think he heard a call, and I think that's a big part of it. You know, I asked him, how do you run your businesses while you're doing this? And he said, well, I probably aren't running them very well, but nonetheless, he's going to stay with it. He gave every indication of that. BAIER: Here is Elon Musk on NGOs. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MUSK: One of the biggest sources of fraud in the world is government funded Non-Governmental Organizations. This is a gigantic fraud loophole where the government can give money to an NGO, and then there are no controls over that NGO, they've given billions of dollars in tech, we estimate tens of billions of dollars to NGOs that are essentially scams. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: So, what about that, Larry? I mean, are the -- is the pot big enough in each one of these places to equal what they're hoping, that one trillion -- originally it was two trillion, but one trillion, let's say, in savings. KUDLOW: Well, I gave him a chance at the revised number. He's staying with the one trillion number. I'm not sure he rules out anything bigger than that, or maybe even smaller than that. He makes a very good point about the NGOs, because really nobody knows what kinds of moneys have been given to them, and whether that had anything to do with congressional laws or mandates. But he wants to build out his team. I mean, I said, how many you got? He said, about 100 and I said, you're going to go larger? And he said, yes, we want to go to 200 and I think he's kind of working out the kinks. I just tried to demystify his whole process so the public, our viewers, could get a chance to see how, where and why he's doing what he's doing. BAIER: Yes, the DOGE savings, they estimate about 105 billion right now, and the amount saved per taxpayer is about $652 right now. You know, we heard a lot in the reporting about fiery exchanges behind the scenes between Elon Musk and Rubio. Here's the president on all that reporting, and his answer to it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: Look, Elon is a very special person, and these cabinet people are special people. I think they have fantastic relationship to Elon, and DOGE has been incredible. That doesn't mean they don't have a little bit of an argument here and there about something. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: So, what about the interactions and what he thinks about getting along playing with others in the playpen? KUDLOW: Well, I asked him about that briefly, and I said, you know, how are you getting along? Howard Lutnick, you know, yesterday, the Commerce Secretary, described their relationships as partners. And I asked him about that, and I think Elon kind of nodded his head. I think he agrees they are partners. But I think, you know, everyone is trying to drive a wedge between Elon and the president, or maybe between Elon the rest of the cabinet. Bret, at this stage of the game, I do not think they're going to succeed in driving any wedges. I think president likes what Elon is doing. I think taxpayers like what Elon is doing. I've seen polls that show 70 percent approval for what those savings are going to look like. And by the way, we had Russ Vought on the OMB Director earlier, as you may know, they're going to translate these DOGE savings through rescissions, which only require a majority vote in the House and Senate, and that's how they're going to take them out of the baseline, and it's going to appear in the Trump budget as well. BAIER: That's interesting. Larry, really quickly. X was, I guess, the cyber-attack on X, Elon Musk property, talk about that, where it's coming from? KUDLOW: Yes. Elon was very clear. I asked him about that. I asked him if it was a foreign source. He was very clear. He said Ukraine. He said Ukraine, without any question. BAIER: Wow. Well, that's interesting too. Larry Kudlow, we appreciate the time. KUDLOW: Thanks, Bret, appreciate it. BAIER: We are just a few days away from the latest deadline to keep the government funded. House Democrats are refusing to support a temporary bill unless it includes provisions to rein in. The aforementioned Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency. Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram is live on Capitol Hill tonight with the latest on that. Good evening, Chad. CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Bret, good evening. Democrats say Republicans left their demands and spending priorities out of the bill. So, if the government shuts down, they'll say it's the responsibility of those who run Washington and a controversial White House adviser. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REP. JIM MCGOVERN (D-MA): Republicans run the house. Republicans run the Senate and the White House is a Republican run circus led by Elon Musk and Donald Trump. If the government shuts down, there is no mystery about who's to blame. PERGRAM (voice over): Kentucky Republican Thomas Massie is a no unless he receives a ""lobotomy."" But House GOP leaders believe the bill passes tomorrow. Still, the bill needs Democrats to overcome a Senate filibuster later this week. That's why the GOP will blame Democrats if the government closes. REP. JAKE ELLZEY (R-TX): But if all of us vote for it, and they don't, and on the Senate side, they don't get the seven across the -- across the aisle to vote for it, we shut down, it's on them. PERGRAM (voice over): Also, the House may not be done punishing Texas Democrat Al Green after He disrupted President Trump's speech last week. Johnson says he's, ""considering removing Green from his committees."" REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): Mr. Green's comments after the event have not helped. Every member has the right to bring a privileged resolution, as you know, which is effectively an end run around the speaker. It's not always my decision on these things. (END VIDEOTAPE) PERGRAM (on camera): The Senate right now is voting to confirm Lori Chavez- DeRemer as labor secretary. The vote right now 58 to 29 so she has the votes to be confirmed. When they close this vote, she likely scores more Democrats than any other Trump nominee besides Secretary of State Marco Rubio. When this vote closes, the Senate is done confirming the entire Trump cabinet, Bret. BAIER: Chad Pergram live on Capitol Hill. Chad, thank you. Up next, there's an app for that, the Trump administration is giving illegal immigrants a chance to deport themselves. We'll explain. And later, the search for a missing American college student in the Dominican Republic. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: A live look at Rome there. Doctors say Pope Francis is no longer in imminent danger of death as a result of pneumonia. They are keeping him hospitalized for several more days to receive treatment. They say the 88- year-old pope remains stable and has consolidated improvements in recent days, as determined by blood tests and positive responses to drug treatments. The pope followed the Vatican's week-long spiritual retreat via video conference as he continued his recovery from double pneumonia. Illegal immigrants who want to get in line to be in the country legally can use a new app from the Trump administration. Correspondent Bill Melugin shows us how it works tonight from Los Angeles. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL MELUGIN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The Trump administration is taking a key pillar of former President Biden's immigration policy. The controversial CBP One cell phone app, and repurposing it into a self-deportation app. It's now called CBP Home, and it officially launched today. The app allows illegal aliens in the U.S. to register to self deport by inputting their biographical information, including their nationality and to which country they plan to deport. They upload photos of themselves to confirm identity and submit it all to CBP. In a statement to Fox News, DHS Secretary, Kristi Noem, says, in part, ""The CBP Home app gives aliens the option to leave now and self deport, so they may still have the opportunity to return legally in the future and live the American Dream. If they don't, we will find them, we will deport them, and they will never return."" According to CBP data, roughly 40,000 to 50,000 migrants were entering the U.S. every month to seek asylum via the CBP One app during the Biden administration, totaling nearly 1 million migrants by the end of his presidency. President Trump terminated the program immediately upon taking office. That led to scenes of dismayed migrants at the border on his inauguration day, after they learned their appointments had been canceled. Trump adviser Stephen Miller posted on X today, ""Go home or go to jail."" (END VIDEOTAPE) MELUGIN: And Bret, DHS tells us that any migrants who had that old CBP One app on their cell phone will now have it automatically update to this new self-deportation app. DHS says it's significantly cheaper for the U.S. if illegal aliens, self deport, rather than using limited ICE resources to go and track them down. We'll send it back to you. BAIER: Bill, we're also hearing that ice carried out a huge operation with hundreds of arrests in Texas. What about that? MELUGIN: Yes, Bret. ICE Houston just announced that in a single week-long operation in the Houston area, they arrested 646 illegal aliens. That is a huge number for one ICE office in one single week. ICE says 543 of those illegal aliens were criminals, 140 of which were aggravated felons, 34 were sex offenders or pedophiles, and 52 had drug trafficking or drug possession charges. This is, by far, the most arrests we've seen from a single operation under this new Trump administration. Bret? BAIER: All right. Bill, thank you. Up next, the alleged mastermind of the Kabul airport bombing that killed 13 Americans appears in U.S. Court. We'll take you there. First, ""BEYOND OUR BORDERS"" tonight. Australia's prime minister says the fallout from a vicious tropical storm over the weekend is far from over. Parts of two states remain inundated with perilous flood waters, even as the initial threat from the deluge continues to recede. One person was killed, several others injured as heavy rain lashed east coast of Australia, Saturday. A cargo ship and a fuel tanker collide off the coast of eastern England. It set both vessels on fire and triggered a major rescue operation. One person is said to still be missing. Search efforts are continuing. And this is a live look at Kaiserslautern, Germany, one of the big stories there tonight, one day strike -- a one-day strike by workers at 13 German airports, the same day leaves travelers stranded and making alternative plans. The 24-hour walkout involves public sector employees at the airports as well as ground and security staff. Such warning strikes are common tactics in German wage negotiations. Just some of the other stories, ""BEYOND OUR BORDERS"" tonight. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: ""BREAKING TONIGHT"", the alleged mastermind behind the Afghanistan airport bombing, the Abbey Gate bombing that killed 13 U.S. military personnel was in a Virginia court today, Mohammad Sharifullah could face life in prison, if convicted of having a role in the Kabul suicide bombing. Correspondent David Spunt is outside the federal court in Alexandria, Virginia tonight. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Mohammad Sharifullah, sat quietly in a federal courtroom just outside Washington, D.C. He is charged with conspiring to help ISIS-K in the August 2021 suicide bombing attack outside the Abbey Gate at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, 13 U.S. service members and approximately 170 civilians killed. Federal prosecutors say he helped ISIS-K navigate the route of the attack. An FBI agent today said, he was not among senior ISIS leadership. In Court, prosecutors asked to keep him in custody, his public defender did not contest. Sharifullah arrived on American soil in the middle of the night after President Trump's address to Congress last week. Watching that arrival, FBI Director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi. As well as CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. According to prosecutors, in an interview with FBI agents on March 2nd, Sharifullah waived his Miranda rights and spilled the story, admitting to helping prepare for the attack and helping look for American and Taliban checkpoints. Authorities say he told other ISIS-K members the route was clear and the attacker would not be detected. Prosecutors say he also inspired ISIS-K members involved in attacks at the Canadian Embassy in Kabul in 2016 and a 2024 city hall attack outside of Moscow, Russia. (END VIDEOTAPE) SPUNT: Sharifullah law is being held in federal custody, pending trial. Bret, a date has yet to be set. BAIER: David Spunt, live in Alexandria. David, thanks. The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to review a challenge to a Colorado law banning so called Conversion Therapy for LGBTQ+ children. A licensed counselor and Christian says her free speech and religious rights are being violated by the restrictions. About half the states ban trying to change someone's gender identity or sexual orientation through counseling. The case will be argued this fall. Breaking tonight, the Trump administration is going after an anti-Israel protester accused of having ties to terrorists. Correspondent Alexis McAdams has the story tonight live from New York. Good evening, Alexis. ALEXIS MCADAMS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Bret, good evening. Tonight, a judge ruling that Mahmoud Khalil cannot be deported just yet, but we're keeping an eye on it because it could be in court later this week. This comes as the Iranian is in federal custody as ICE says he was leading activities that align with Hamas. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TOM HOMAN, WHITE HOUSE BORDER CZAR: When you come here to study, you've got to obey the laws of this country. You've got to obey the requirements of that visa to be lawful while you're here. (END VIDEO CLIP) MCADAMS: President Trump posting on Truth Social saying this is the first of many arrests to come, writing in part, ""We know that there are more students at Columbia and other universities across this country who have engaged in pro-terrorist, antisemitic, anti-American activity, and the Trump administration will no tolerate it."" Julio's lawyer says ICE agents revoked his green card and his student visa over the weekend, coming just days after he was spotted here at a protest inside of the library at Barnard College. Considered a trespasser because he is not even a student here. That was the same protest where these pamphlets were handed out, look at these, claiming to be from the Hamas media office, calling the October 7th attack by Hamas a moral victory. These photos of terror leaders also handed out to students inside and stuck on windows near campus. Separately, students say Khalil has led dozens of pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University for months, demanding the ivy league school divest from Israel. Back out here live, we are hearing he could be in court on Wednesday. This as there's more protests expected. You can see here on your screen this was a scuffle, Bret, that happened just not far from here in New York City. The protests will continue as hundreds are commanding Khalil's release. But the Trump administration says they are just getting started. Bret? BAIER: Alexis McAdams live in New York. Alexis, thanks. Tonight, searchers are looking for a University of Pittsburgh student who is missing in the Dominican Republic. Correspondent Steve Harrigan has the latest from Atlanta. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) STEVE HARRIGAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: A desperate search by, air, land, and in the water for a University of Pittsburgh student who went missing on spring break in the Dominican Republic. Sudiksha Konanki was last seen on surveillance video just after 4:00 a.m. Thursday headed to the beach when seven others at the Riu Republica Hotel in Punta Cana according to Dominican national police. JASON MIYARES, (R) VIRGINIA ATTORNEY GENERAL: Obviously, our number one goal is to find her hopefully safe and sound. HARRIGAN: The 20-year-old premed student from Virginia was with her friends and several young men but reportedly stayed behind on the beach with one of the men while her friends returned to the resort. She was reported missing around 4:00 p.m. that day. Dominican investigators have been talking to those last seen with her. MIKE CHAPMAN, (R) LOUDOUN COUNTY, VIRGINIA, SHERIFF: We're not ruling anything in or out. We want to make sure that we're turning over every single rock before we come to any conclusions here. HARRIGAN: Her father, who is also an Indian national and a permanent U.S. resident in Virginia, says he spoke to his daughter the night before she vanished. While there were initial reports that she may have drowned, her father fears she may have been abducted. SUBBARAYUDU KONANKI, FATHER: My daughter said that she was during spring break, and everything was going OK. And she was really happy. HARRIGAN: The FBI says it's offered assistance to Dominican authorities. PAUL MAURO, FORMER NYPD INSPECTOR: If anybody has seen this poor girl, the information may come from an informant in the area that the local police have developed. There's a lot give and take in areas like this between the police and the local informants. (END VIDEO TAPE) HARRIGAN: So far no one arrested or charged with any crime. Bret? BAIER: Steve Harrigan live in Atlanta. Steve, thanks. Up next, the panel on the Trump economy, Larry Kudlow's interview with Elon Musk. First, here's what some of our FOX affiliates around the country are covering tonight. FOX 11 in Los Angeles as a burglary suspect who was shot by a security guard after he crashed his car into a weed dispensary dies from his injuries. Police say the guard saw the driver wearing a ski mask and shot at him. A witnesses reported seeing a second male subject run from the scene. The guard is not facing charges at this time. And this is a live look at Indianapolis. One of the big stories there tonight from FOX 59, our affiliate, the Outlaw Music Festival announces a tour stop in Indianapolis. The performance by Willie Nelson, Bob Dylan, Sheryl Crow, and others will be at the Ruoff Music Center September 18th. The traveling festival has become a hallmark of Americana artists since its inception in 2016. That's tonight's live look outside the beltway from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ELON MUSK, PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER: I'm just here trying to make government more efficient, eliminate waste and fraud. And so far, we are making good progress. REP. RO KHANNA, (D-CA): Elon Musk and the president should come to Congress before engaging in not spending congressionally appropriated money. There is a genuine concern, real concern among people in our caucus that they are not following the Constitution's separation of powers. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Talk about Elon Musk, a lot of talk about DOGE, a lot of back and forth about what's happening behind the scenes, including arguments from different agencies, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio. He put out a tweet, an X post, saying the cancelation of 83 percent of USAID programs after a six week review, 5,200 contracts are now canceled, spent tens of billions of dollars in ways that did not serve, in come cases even harmed the core national interests of the United States. He's thanking DOGE and the hardworking staff for this historic reform. With that, let's bring in our panel, FOX News chief political analyst Brit Hume, Guy Benson, political editor at Townhall.com and host of ""The Guy Benson Show"" on FOX News Radio, ""THE FIVE"" co-host Jessica Tarlov, and Ben Domenech, editor at large for ""The Spectator"", host of ""The Ben Domenech Podcast"" on FOX News Radio. OK, Brit, what do you make about all of this focus? And obviously, Larry talked to Elon today. BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, he's a man of the hour, the person everybody is talking about, the man that the Democrats are complaining about, even perhaps more than they are about Donald Trump. What I would say about Musk is that USAID was a very smart target to pick first because the levels of waste and money spent in ways not really approved by Congress or specified by much of anybody except the people at that agency were a pretty juicy target and he has hit it pretty hard. It's going to become more difficult with time as some of the stresses and strains we have seen already suggest as more politically sensitive areas come into focus and cuts are suggested in those areas. BAIER: Yes, and Jessica, he is saying to Larry that he wants to go from 100 to 200 staff workers at DOGE in every agency. JESSICA TARLOV, CO-HOST, ""THE FIVE"": Yes. Well, let's see what happens. If the reporting is true from last week's cabinet meeting it sounds like Donald Trump was siding with Secretary Duffy and Secretary Rubio over Elon Musk, and he has kind of being pushed to the outside. He still gets to go Mar-a-Lago for the weekend, which I know is a very big deal in all of this, but we will see how much power he actually wields. If Musk was serious about making cuts, he would have started with the Pentagon. We know that you have to go through there if you want to make any true major cuts, or entitlements, which he did say to Larry that he was open to doing. Now, that flies in the face of what Donald Trump has always maintained. He said I'm not going to go after Medicare and Social Security and Medicaid. So that's setting up a real show down, and that's exactly where the Democrats want to see the Republicans admitting that they are coming for those entitlement programs. It's bad for the American people, and it's resonating with them as well that they are open to making those cuts like we saw in the spending bill. BAIER: Here, Guy, is Larry asking about the cyberattack on X. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LARRY KUDLOW, HOST, ""KUDLOW"" ON FOX BUSINESS: Everyone is attacking you for your position, what are you doing in the government. There was a cyberattack on X today which shut it down and may have been foreign sourced. It's a big story. Do you want to give us a moment on that? ELON MUSK, TELSA CEO: Well, we are not sure exactly what happened. But there was massive cyberattack to try to bring down the X system with I.P. addresses originating in the Ukraine area. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: No follow up there as far as we don't know for sure. There is another group tied to Palestinians that said they were taking credit for it. But, Guy, speaking of Ukraine, there was this back and forth with Senator Mark Kelly, Democrat from Arizona. Kelly had just gotten back from Ukraine. He posted that on X what he saw proved to me we can't give up on the Ukrainian people. Everyone wants this war to end but any agreement has to protect Ukraine's security and can't be a giveaway to Putin. Let me tell you about my trip and why it's important we stand with Ukraine. And Elon Musk retweeted saying ""You are a traitor."" He then retweeted that. ""Traitor? Elon, if you don't understand that defending freedom is a basic tenet of what makes America great and keeps us safe, maybe you should leave it to those of us who do."" So a back and forth. It was not in Larry's interview. It happened in the afternoon. But we wanted to get it in there. It is something to call somebody a traitor like that. GUY BENSON, POLITICAL EDITOR, TOWNHALL.COM: Yes, that's a very heated thing to say. I'm not a huge fan of Senator Kelly. I disagree with him on most things. I generally agree with him, at least partially, on the Ukraine question, but him going there and making, I think, a fairly rational case for his position on an important foreign policy issue is not a treasonous act. I think sometimes these words get thrown around. And it really distracts dramatically from what Elon Musk is trying to do in his actual portfolio, which is DOGE, which is a mission that I fully support. I don't love seeing that sort of rhetoric. I can understand why Senator Kelly took exception to it. I don't think it's a great look for Elon Musk, and I hope he would focus on the actual important things that he has been tasked with. BAIER: One of the important things, Ben, is the state of the U.S. economy. And the president over the weekend was asked by Maria about how things stand. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARIA BARTIROMO: I know that you inherited a mess. DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: I have only been here -- BARTIROMO: Are you expecting a recession this year? TRUMP: I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition, because what we are doing is very big. We are bringing wealth back to America. That's a big thing. And there are always periods of -- it takes a little time. It takes a little time. But I think it should be great for us. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: He's basically predicting, Ben, stronger in the future, but it may be bumpy a little bit. A lot of people interpreted that answer and ran with it today, and obviously the markets have been jittery. BEN DOMENECH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: One of the things I think that speaks to is the fact that it takes time to adjust to new realities. You look at car manufacturers for instance and the decisions they're going to have to make about how much of their operation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 I just want to correct something about the way that everyone is viewing Elon Musk's relationship with this government. This is not Elon Musk just versus the administrative state, the bureaucracy, et cetera. It's also Elon Musk versus Republican political appointees, meaning people who are within the staff themselves who view their role, improperly, in my view, unpatriotically, in my view, as defending the bureaucracies that they inhabit, viewing them as defending turf that they have been invested in money from Congress that they now need to defend against those who want to cut it. The idea that we can't cut in some of these bureaucratic programs that I'm familiar with, that you're familiar, that so many of us are familiar with, where we see the waste, the fraud, the abuse, the pork spending that is ridiculous, the billions of dollars that go to things like rural broadband that don't connect anybody after years, all of these places have enormous fat that can be cut. And I think that the real role that Elon has is coming in and giving the tough message to those same politically appointed bureaucrats, Republicans oftentimes who feel like their role is to defend the bureaucracy that they represent as opposed to finding things to cut. BAIER: Yes, Brit, quickly, we always seem like we're one election away from doing the big things. Your thoughts on the state of the U.S. economy as the president has described it. HUME: Well, we had a big downdraft in the stock market today, but as I think they old saying goes, the stock market has predicted 10 of the last three recessions, so the two do not necessarily equate. (LAUGHTER) HUME: And I would not go so far to say that anyone should be predicting a recession. BAIER: All right, panel, stand by, if you will. We're going to talk about the next fiscal cliff and what we're facing up on Capitol Hill. But as we go to break, we are sad to announce a death of a FOX News original, cameraman Craig Savage. He died Sunday after a courageous battle with cancer. Craig joined our team four days before we launched in 1996. He spent his career working at the White House. I worked with him there. Craig helped shoot our first presidential interview with then President Bill Clinton. He was involved in nearly every presidential interview after that. Craig's expertise was crucial during then President George W. Bush's secret 2003 trip to Iraq to visit troops for Thanksgiving. His proficiency in delivering footage under the most stringent conditions were a real testament to his skill and dedication. I worked with him, as I mentioned, many times here in the U.S. and many times overseas. Craig is survived by his wife, FOX News senior producer Anne Marie Riha, along several children and grandchildren. Craig Savage was 61. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON, (R-LA) HOUSE SPEAKER: The CR will pass. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What if part of it gets blocked? JOHNSON: I don't think it's going to get blocked. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What makes you so confident it will pass? JOHNSON: Because no one wants to shut the government down, and we are governing, doing the responsible thing as Republicans. It's going to be up to Chuck Schumer and the Senate Democrats to do the right thing. I don't think they're going to shut the government down. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Well, they're working on a continuing resolution to fund the government. There is at least one Republican who is already out saying he is not voting for that. It's not a surprise. Thomas Massie posted he'll be voting no," """"Unless I got a lobotomy Monday that causes me to forget what I witnessed the past 12 years"," I'll be a no on the CR this week. It amazes me that my colleagues and many in the public fall for the lie that we will fight another day."""" Back with the panel. Guy", no surprise there, but there is this increasing confidence, and the president is making calls to try get this funding bill going. BENSON: Yes. There were some people sort of shrugging or eye-rolling, why is Speaker Johnson so confident about this? Maybe he's wistfully thinking about it. This is an aspirational comment, except a lot of those same attitudes played out a few weeks ago and he ended up winning the day on that budget bill. So, maybe he has got the votes teed up. The Democrats are doing opposition 101, which if it's going to be a partisan bill, it's a fairly clean CR, but if it's a partisan bill, force the majority party with their tiny margin to pass it with little to no Democratic help. But Speaker Johnson has a big element of help here. As you mentioned, the president of the United States reportedly making calls, working the phones, trying to get this thing across the line, which is what the White House wants. BAIER: Jessica, it's clear that Democrats are not going for this, or at least they are whipping no on this vote. TARLOV: Yes, it's not just whipping. They are going to be a no on this bill. There's no reason for Democrats to support a continuing resolution that they, first of all, weren't consulted on at all. No one came to say, hey, what do you think about these things? And then they would have heard, hey, we are not OK with cutting nutritional assistance. We're not OK with cutting veterans benefits, Social Security benefits, Alzheimer's research. So there's no reason that Democrats should bail out the Republicans. We have been hearing since the election that this is largest mandate in American history. So prove it. And Guy may very well be right that Speaker Johnson can get this over the hurdle, and then they have a whole year to figure out how to govern, how to get their spending bill that's going to cut, what $880 billion from Medicaid. So, time will tell on that. But we're not here to bail them out. DOMENECH: I hope, Jessica is totally successful. I hope she's completely successful. TARLOV: Thanks, Ben. DOMENECH: And I hope that this goes the way that you want, because I can't wait to see what DOGE will do when the government is shut down. If the government shuts down, the amount of things that you can do where the traps just open up where they can just cut even further than they already have, you'll find out, and it's going to be a lot of fun. I'm totally -- TARLOV: How many people are enough for you to get fired? What's your goal? How many tens of thousands do you want just fired? DOMENECH: Can we start with half? Is that like a reasonable number? TARLOV: Is that really what you think of public service? DOMENECH: I think that you are making a monumentally stupid decision in terms of whipping in this direction. And I think that Chuck Schumer is quite correctly trying to prevent Hakeem Jefferies from making a huge mistake that would only benefit those of us who think that the government is just full of pork to be cut and that bureaucrats absolutely should be sent packing. BAIER: Let me get Brit in here. It's expected to pass the House tomorrow, possibly pass the Senate on Thursday. But, again, it's another continuing resolution. We are punting to the big, beautiful bill, whenever that is going to happen. HUME: That's right. And I think the issue here is not the House. I think this bill will pass the House, this bill to keep the government open, but they do need Democratic votes because it is subject to filibuster in the Senate, and they don't have a majority big enough to cover that, so they will need some Democrats. The question then becomes whether, if, indeed, Democrats do not provide those votes, and the government thereafter shuts down, which is what would happen, and it's not a full shut down, we all know that, but it's a partial shutdown. And nobody ever likes it. And the party that gets blamed always suffers from it. And the Democrats, I think, seem to think that because the they are the party of government nobody will blame them. That may be different this time it will be pretty plainly obvious that by refusing to provide a handful of votes they caused the government shutdown. So I'm not sure they will be able to escape it this time, but we'll see if they're going to try. BAIER: All right, quickly, Guy, final word? BENSON: Step one is in the House. And I don't think that hurdle has cleared just yet. If it does go to the Senate it would be pretty wild to see the Democrats use a filibuster that they pretended to hate for a long time to shut down the government. I don't think that's an argument that they want to have, but they might have that on their hands soon. We'll see. BAIER: And we won't put it on your hands, Jessica. It'll just be on their hands. TARLOV: You take it, yes. (LAUGHTER) BAIER: All right, thank you so much. Panel, I appreciate it.

Harris Faulkner talks about her time at Southern University A&M College,2025-02-24T00:00:00Z,Harris Faulkner,"OUTNUMBERED OVERTIME 11:50 AM EST Fox News, OUTNUMBERED OVERTIME11:50 AM EST, NEWS, 445words",U.S. Federal,"HARRIS FAULKNER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: February is Black History Month. And, as you often hear me say, this month recognizes our shared American history. And my team and I are making some history today too, broadcasting ""The Faulkner Focus"" from the beautiful campus of Southern University A&M College. Southern is one of America's 107 historically black colleges and universities; 8,000 students on this campus have a school mission, to become graduates who are equipped to excel in a 21st century knowledge- based global economy. And they are doing it. Last night, I was humbled and honored to be presented with the chancellor's award for lifetime excellence and achievement in journalism. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FAULKNER: I'm just speechless. You see me. You see where I have been. You know. And I'm so grateful for that. Today has been so amazing. I mean, the faculty here with the leadership and the vision of chancellor and also the chairman and all those who participate in the greatness of the children that you are helping to raise, because it takes more than a village. It takes everybody. I mean, all of that is a reflection the power and the necessity for HBCUs right now. This is such a great, great honor today. And I share it with all of you. (END VIDEO CLIP) FAULKNER: The chancellor, John Pierre, who presented the award to me, also gave me an extensive tour of the campus. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN K. PIERRE, CHANCELLOR, SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY AND A&M COLLEGE: What we do is, we take students from a lot of rural areas and from other areas that are underserved and we say, you can achieve. You may not have had all the resources you needed to be at the top of the chain in terms of college admission, but you can achieve, because, when you work hard and we work hard with you, we get you to where you're going to be in the future. And we want to be a transformational institution. When you think about these kinds of things, faith is very, very important. Our people had to be faithful to believe that they could achieve higher education status, because they didn't have a lot of money. FAULKNER: Right. PIERRE: They didn't have a lot of political power, but they had faith in God and themselves and the tenacity and the resilience to make great things happen. (END VIDEO CLIP) FAULKNER: One of the many highlights of my day on campus was getting up close with the school's world-renowned band, the Human Jukebox. They serenaded me Southern-style and spelled out F-O-X, FOX, baby. They were in marching formation while they did that. A few weeks ago, this is the same band that opened this year's Super Bowl in New Orleans. And it was amazing.

JESSICA TARLOV, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Gross. Stop. BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Love the sexy animal news. I really do. Thanks, Jesse. Good evening. I'm Bret Baier. Breaking tonight, we're two months into President Trump's second term, and we have new Fox polling that shows how Americans are feeling about some of his policy decisions. Most voters favored President Trump's proposals on banning biological males and women's sports, designating English as the U.S. national language, deporting illegal immigrants and increasing oil drilling. Most voters opposed President Trump's efforts to reduce the number of government employees, changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America and ranking near the bottom in support his campaign promised to close the Department of Education. Well, today, President Trump signed an executive order directing Education Secretary Linda McMahon to begin that process. We will speak live with Secretary McMahon later in this show, the agency likely still needs a failing grade from Congress too before it can be dropped for good. Senior White House Correspondent Jacqui Heinrich takes a look at the department's report card and the actions today. Good evening, Jacqui. JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. Congress created the Education Department and would need to dismantle it with Democratic votes to overcome the Senate filibuster. The president said tonight, he hopes Democrats do the right thing if this comes before them, but a similar push in Congress failed during his first term. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HEINRICH (voice over): President Trump delivering on a campaign promise to turn education over to the states. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Hopefully she will be our last Secretary of Education, Linda McMahon. HEINRICH (voice over): The plan calls to preserve federal funding for students with disabilities, low income schools and student loans and grants, shuffling oversight to other agencies. KAROLINE LEAVITT, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: This federal bureaucracy that has taken more than $3 trillion from the American taxpayer since its inception in 1979 and what have we had as a result of that investment in our children's education? Declining test scores. HEINRICH (voice over): The Nation's Report Card shows math proficiency at 39 percent in fourth graders, 28 percent for eighth grade. In reading, fourth graders 31 percent proficient, eighth graders sitting at 30 percent. But the National Education Association says the move will, ""Hurt all students by sending class sizes soaring, cutting job training programs, making higher education more expensive."" New Fox polls show 92 percent of Democrats oppose shuttering the department, plus 81 percent of Independents and more than a third of Republicans. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): We have started doing this day in, day out, every day, fighting relentlessly. His numbers have gone started to go down. HEINRICH (voice over): Meantime, progress toward implementing a partial cease fire in Russia's war on Ukraine. TRUMP: I believe we'll get it done. HEINRICH (voice over): And a revived minerals deal. TRUMP: One of the things we are doing is signing a deal very shortly, with respect to rare earths, with Ukraine. HEINRICH (voice over): Zelenskyy today appearing to dismiss Trump's proposal, the U.S. take ownership of Ukraine's nuclear power plants for long term security. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): All nuclear power plants belong to the people of Ukraine. HEINRICH (voice over): While leaving the door open to one currently under Russian occupation. ZELENSKYY (through translator): That is a completely different issue. We are open to discuss it. (END VIDEOTAPE) HEINRICH (on camera): Tonight, the Financial Times is reporting Europe's biggest military powers are working on a proposal to avoid chaos if the U.S. withdraws from NATO, it reportedly includes a gradual transfer from U.S. leadership over five to 10 years, allowing the U.S. to ultimately turn focus to Asia, while giving Europe time to scale up its defenses. The president has repeatedly called on NATO allies to pay their fair share, stoking concern within Europe about the U.S. commitment to NATO Article 5, Bret. BAIER: Jacqui Heinrich live in the North Lawn. Jacqui, thank you. A judge has ordered the Trump administration cannot deport a Georgetown University Doctoral Fellow. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials arrested that researcher who is in the U.S. on a student visa over allegations he has connections to a senior adviser to Hamas. Georgetown has denied those claims. Correspondent Mark Meredith looks at this case from Georgetown's campus. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MARK MEREDITH, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Tonight, Badar Khan Suri, an Indian national in the U.S. legally on a student visa is in federal custody. The Trump administration alleges Suri spread pro-Hamas propaganda and has ties to a suspected terrorist. ""The secretary of state issued a determination on March 15th Suri's activities and presence in the U.S. rendered him deportable."" Suri social media pages are no longer public. His legal team did not return our multiple calls for comment, but Reuters says Suri's lawyers told them, if an accomplished scholar who focuses on conflict resolution is whom the government decides is bad for foreign policy, then perhaps the problem is with the government, not the scholar. Suri is a post-doctoral scholar at Georgetown University. His wife is a Palestinian heritage and a U.S. citizen. In a petition seen by Fox, his supporters say he has no criminal record as being unfairly targeted over support for Palestinian rights. Late today, the ACLU of Virginia joined the case. Suri's detention comes two weeks after the administration arrested Columbia University protest organizer Mahmoud Khalil, who the Trump administration says poses potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences. Today, the ACLU published a letter Khalil wrote, saying, my detention is a testament to the strength of the student movement in shifting public opinion toward Palestinian liberation. But critics argue the administration is sending a message, foreigners on student visas cannot support terror groups. DENISE COHEN, ATTORNEY: He's becoming a martyr, you know, for First Amendment protections, and this has nothing to do with the First Amendment. (END VIDEOTAPE) MEREDITH(on camera): While Khalil's arrest in New York sparked protests, so far, things on Georgetown's campus look fairly calm. The University says it is aware of this case and that they also believe in free speech, but are waiting for the legal process to play out. Lawyers for Suri are already in the process of trying to get his case moved back to the East Coast, Bret. BAIER: Mark Meredith at Georgetown. Mark, thanks. The Justice Department has missed a deadline to answer questions about the deportation flights to El Salvador, the DOJ calling the court's request judicial overreach. Correspondent David Spunt reports on this escalating court fight. Good evening, David. DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Bret, good evening, and it is escalating. The tension between this federal judge and the Justice Department is escalating. No question it's rising. Judge James Boasberg today announced that he's upset and frustrated that DOJ missed this deadline earlier today. The deadline was at noon. He wanted questions answered about these two flights that left U.S. airspace and landed in El Salvador, flights of suspected Venezuelan gang members. He scolded DOJ. Last week, he ordered the planes be turned around, but two of them were already outside airspace and landed. Those planes are now in El Salvador and those people in a Salvadorian prison. Now, U.S. officials removed them under a 1798 law called the Alien Enemies Act, citing an invasion of the U.S. Judge Boasberg wanted DOJ to answer questions about the flights. For example, what time did the plane take off from U.S. soil and where and what time did it leave U.S. airspace. The DOJ instead invoked the state secrets privilege, Bret, which allows the government to withhold national security information in court. Boasberg wrote in a terse order out this afternoon that, ""The government again evaded its obligations,"" when he received notice from an ICE official in Texas that the government would invoke the state secret doctrine. His apparent frustration grew writing, this is woefully insufficient. To begin, the government cannot proffer a regional ICE official to attest to cabinet level discussions of the state's secret privilege. A DOJ official tells Fox News, the Department of Justice continues to believe that the court's superfluous questioning of sensitive national security information is inappropriate judicial overreach. There's a hearing tomorrow, Bret, in this case before Judge Boasberg, an in person hearing. We expect fireworks there. Separately, another federal judge in Maryland is stopping the Department of government efficiency, better known as DOGE, from gaining access to the Social Security Administration, a loss for the administration, but this is a temporary restraining order now, and another power struggle between the administration to change government and shrink government, a power struggle that could end up at the Supreme Court, Bret. BAIER: David, thank you. Also breaking tonight, Attorney General Pam Bondi has announced severe charges for suspects accused of damaging Tesla cars and facilities. The FBI is investigating the latest wave of attacks. Senior Correspondent Alicia Acuna reports on the latest incidents from the Denver area, where at least one suspect has been charged. Good evening, Alicia. ALICIA ACUNA, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. And now there are more reports of private Tesla owners getting yelled at in public and finding their vehicles damaged, an indication of just how far the backlash against Elon Musk and DOGE has gone. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ACUNA (voice over): Police in San Jose have arrested this unidentified man accused of keying the side of a Tesla parked outside a Costco. Video of the vandalism caught on one of the vehicle's cameras, which was activated when the owner put it in sentry mode. This incident just one example of Tesla vehicle owners reporting they are now the targets of those angry with Tesla CEO Elon Musk and his work with President Trump. Today, Musk announced on X, ""Tesla has ramped up security and activated sentry mode on all vehicles at stores."" The decision coming after a series of fire bombings and vandalism at Tesla dealerships and charging stations in at least 11 states since the end of January, police in Lakewood, Colorado are looking for the person who cut all the cords at this Tesla Supercharger station. As President Trump and the DOJ say, those caught will face the harshest penalties. So far, three suspects in Oregon, South Carolina and Colorado face federal charges. The FBI has not said if these apparently politically motivated attacks are connected. LEAVITT: It is getting dangerous, and the White House wholeheartedly condemns it, and we applaud Attorney General Pam Bondi for investigating these acts as domestic terrorism. (END VIDEOTAPE) ACUNA (on camera): And the Department of Justice reiterated today, those charged in the vandalism and arson cases face up to 20 years in prison if convicted, Bret. BAIER: Alicia, thank you. Stocks slipped today, led by technology, consumer staples and industrial sectors, investors are weighing the Federal Reserve's interest rate outlook and uncertainty over trade relations. The Dow dropped 11. S&P 500 lost 12. The NASDAQ fell 59, Up next, we speak live with Education Secretary Linda McMahon about President Trump's efforts to essentially put her out of work. And later, a high stakes election in the swing state of Wisconsin, and what it could tell us about President Trump's agenda. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JIMMY CARTER, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: My guess is that the best move for the quality of life in America in the future might very well be this establishment of this new Department of Education. RONALD REAGAN, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The budget plan I submit to you on February 8 will realize major savings by dismantling the Departments of Energy and Education. TRUMP: I told Linda, Linda, I hope you do a great job and put yourself out of a job. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Well, President Trump today signed an executive order that begins the process of closing the Department of Education. With that, let's bring in Secretary of Education, Linda McMahon. She leads that agency. We don't know for how long, Madam Secretary, thank you for the time on a rainy day in Washington. How does this work? I want to talk first about the process. What happened today with the executive order, how do you expect to get legislation to undo the Department of Education to get through something like the Senate with a 60 vote threshold? LINDA MCMAHON, U.S. EDUCATION SECRETARY: Well, Bret, thank you very much for having me this evening. I can tell you we know that the task ahead certainly has some hurdles, but what my desire is, and what I'm going to be working to do, is to work in conjunction with Congress. I think if we can show them that the best plan is to have states in control of education for their communities, for their students, for their teachers, for their parents, that is the best thing, because the President believes, as do I, that the best education is closest to the -- you know, closest to the student, and we can accomplish that by having it operate out of the state, and not trying to manage it from Washington, D.C. which clearly Bret that hasn't worked. The Department of Education was set up in 1980 by President Carter. We spent almost $3 trillion we've seen our scores continue to decline. We're doing something wrong. We need to change. BAIER: The president seemed to be very careful in what he said that it would be done lawfully to unwind the Department of Education, and the director of it says, to the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law, take all appropriate steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education. Is there like a hedging of those words, because, you know, you legally can't really erase it without those votes? MCMAHON: Well, I think he was correct in saying that we were going to do everything legally. That's what he said to me from the very beginning. He would like for me to move as swiftly as we can, because he believes the sooner that we can close the department, the more efficiently we can have the funds distributed to the states, and perhaps they will even have more funding when there isn't the overhead and bureaucracy from the Department of Education. But clearly he wanted to state and let Congress know that he intends to work with them. I want Congress to be a partner in this, and I believe they will be, because both sides of the aisle know that what is happening to education in our country cannot be allowed to stand because we are failing our students. BAIER: The left is obviously very upset about this. I'll take it from both sides, as you're pointing out. Here is Randi Weingarten. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RANDI WEINGARTEN, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TEACHERS: A kid who has disabilities, a kid who is poor, a kid who's going to head start, a kid who's in a rural area, they're talking about taking this money away from kids and putting it into block grants and giving it as vouchers, which basically serve kids who are already in private schools. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: So, I'd like you to address that directly. MCMAHON: Well, certainly, Randi Weingarten and I have not had any opportunity to have a conversation. I at one point heard her say a day or two ago that president was going to take education away from children. And clearly that's not what we're going to do. We want to make education better for children. The president is an absolute proponent of school choice, and we are going to work very hard to make sure that children are not held prisoner in failing schools. Over the past couple of days, I have toured charter schools throughout the state of Florida, and I went to one school that's called a classical school, where they were really back to basics with their multiplication tables and reading by phonics, returning to the science of reading. These children were absolutely joyous in their classroom. They were having fun. The teacher was having fun. They were reciting their times tables in this fourth grade. And I'm sorry, 4-year-olds doing this, and they were just amazing. So, we want to see that kind of enthusiasm and that kind of success rate in every school across the country. BAIER: And just to put some stats on it, you were born in New Bern, North Carolina, which is Craven County, North Carolina, that's a rural region. MCMAHON: I was. BAIER: And if you look at the math and reading scores, and we have this graphic here, 21 to 24, you can see math in 21 and 22 and reading 51.6, 49.9 and then 23, 24 actually goes down, 46.5 to 48.6. That tracks other places around the country that have seen proficiency go down despite the level of money going up. MCMAHON: Well, I think that's been the president's, you know, human cry. He said, we are spending more money per pupil than any country in the world, and we're seeing less results. That's a clear indicator that we are not doing the best thing we can do for our students. I do think returning to basics is the best way to do it. We need to teach math and English and literacy and writing. We don't need to teach ideology. We have to let teachers teach. I have such respect for our teachers. I think it is the most noble profession in the world, and I have seen what can happen when teachers are allowed to teach and to be innovative and be creative in their classrooms. You know, Bret, for every dollar that goes into the school system, the federal funding, it's been reported to me that almost $0.47 of that dollar is spent in regulatory compliance. Teachers, they don't want to stay. They're leaving the profession because they are bogged down by regulation. Let's lift that burden and let them do what they do best, which is teach. BAIER: I've played the Randi Weingarten and from the left, Bernie Sanders, other people on Capitol Hill on the left, you know, obviously coming after you for this and the president for this move. Let me talk to you from the right quickly. Why send the money to the states for them to administer? States like California, New York, Illinois, who conservatives would say have not had a great track record. Why not send the money to the States as a pass through, and then they must give the money to parents and let them pick the schools and the instruction of their choice? MCMAHON: Well, that's one opportunity. I think we should explore that. In fact, I heard former Secretary Bennett this morning talking about sending money directly to the students. So, let's take a look at that. I think there is not -- I don't think there's one thing that's mutually exclusive. Let's figure out what the best plan is. Talk with the governors. That's one of the things I'm doing. I just started, only been there a couple of weeks, but I've already started traveling around the country talking to different governors, getting them on the phone, talking with different superintendent heads to say, what can we do better? How can we help you? What kind of tools can we provide you? What kind of plans for best practices can we make available to you so that you can see what other states have done and done successfully? And that's going to be the goal. Let's make sure that we are providing as much information to our states as we can so that we can get the best outcomes. BAIER: So, if you work yourself out of a job, you get the votes in Congress. What do you do next? MCMAHON: Well, I don't know, the sky's the limit. I do enjoy -- I do enjoy public service. This is my second time of serving in an administration. I enjoy being on school boards. I've done that. I've been on the Board of Education for a university for 16 years. I resigned from those, you know, when you join the government. So, those are things I would -- I'll enjoy getting back to. But you know, first things first, let's take care of the Department of Education. Let's make sure our students are well taken care of. BAIER: Madam Secretary, we appreciate your time. MCMAHON: Thank you, Bret. BAIER: Up next, an American is on his way home after being held captive by the Taliban for more than two years. And later, a New Jersey hospital is asking parents to pick a name and a gender for their newborns. We'll take a look at the controversial questionnaire. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Early voting has begun in Wisconsin for a high stakes Supreme Court race that could shape the state's ideological balance for the next decade. Wealthy donors and prominent politicians are putting this race in the national spotlight, but their goal is to sway the voters of one of the most competitive battleground states. Senior correspondent Mike Tobin reports from Madison. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) MIKE TOBIN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Intended as a nonpartisan contest, the election of a Supreme Court justice in Wisconsin is shaping up as the first hyper-partisan challenge since President Trump's victory in November. The race pairing Judge Susan Crawford from liberal hotbed Dane County against conservative Judge Brad Schimel from Waukesha has big money outside donors like George Soros, J.B. Pritzker, and Elon Musk opening their wallets. JUDGE SUSAN CRAWFORD, WISCONSIN SUPREME COURT CANDIDATE: They can vote for me or they can choose a partisan politician, somebody who is willing to put this seat up to the highest bidder. JUDGE BRAD SCHIMEL, WISCONSIN SUPREME COURT CANDIDATE: Ninety-seven percent of my donors vote in Wisconsin. My opponent, almost half of her donors don't vote in Wisconsin. TOBIN: At stake, a law from 1849 banning abortions currently before the court. Wisconsin's Act 10, which strips state employee unions of collective bargaining power, and drew thousands of protestors, is expected to be challenged. And redistricting, which could threaten not only the conservative hold on power in Wisconsin but also change who Wisconsin sends to the U.S. House of Representatives. SCOTT WALKER, (R) FORMER WISCONSIN GOVERNOR: They see this as their path to taking the House back over the next two years and blocking the things that Donald Trump wants to do. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: For Susan Crawford, it's a pattern, putting pedophiles back on the street. TOBIN: Wisconsin airwaves are flooded with commercials, both candidates accusing the other of being soft or negligent on crime. Crawford calling her conservative opponent an antiabortion crusader. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He wants to take us back to the 1849 law -- UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: -- that bans abortion for rape and health of the mother. (END VIDEO TAPE) TOBIN: On one hand, the candidates promise objective decision-making based on law. On the other they campaign talking about partisan ideals. Spending in this campaign has already broken the U.S. record for a state Supreme Court race. Bret? BAIER: Mike Tobin in Madison, Wisconsin. Mike, thank you. Now news overseas. A U.S. citizen held captive in Afghanistan is now on his way home. He is the third American detainee released by the Taliban since January. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the release a positive step and said President Trump will continue efforts to release all unjustly detained Americans held overseas. Chief foreign affairs correspondent Trey Yingst reports from Tel Aviv. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) TREY YINGST, FOX NEWS CHIEF FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT: American citizen George Glezmann is coming home. The 65-year-old was held by the Taliban in Afghanistan since December of 2022. Now, after weeks of negotiations conducted by American and Qatari mediators, Glezmann will be reunited with his family. DENNIS FITZPATRICK, GLEZMANN ATTORNEY: They identified George's case as a priority on the first day of the Trump administration. And since then, I know that they have been working every single day to secure his release. YINGST: U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio thanking Qatar in a statement, saying its ""steadfast commitment and diplomatic efforts were instrumental in securing George's release. Qatar has consistently proven to be a reliable partner and trusted mediator facilitating complex negotiations."" Sources familiar with the release say the Trump administration did not have to give up anything in return for Glezmann's freedom. This was considered a good will gesture from the Taliban which has been in control of Afghanistan following the U.S. withdrawal in the summer of 2021. Trump envoy Adam Boehler was personally involved in the talks and is currently escorting Glezmann home. HAFIZ ZIA AHMAD, AFGHAN FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTRY: The U.S. special envoy for hostage affairs, Mr. Adam Boehler, considered the progress made regarding prisoners between Afghanistan and the U.S. as a positive step towards building trust. (END VIDEO TAPE) YINGST: Glezmann's return is the latest in a series of efforts by the Trump administration to bring U.S. citizens home. Bret? BAIER: Trey, thank you. Air raid sirens sounded in central Jerusalem after a missile launched from Yemen, the Houthis there. Israel says it intercepted the missile launched by Yemen's Houthi rebel group. It comes after U.S. airstrikes targeted Houthi held areas in Yemen last weekend. Up next, expecting New Jersey parents receive an unexpected survey about the gender of their newborns. We'll bring you that story. First, Beyond our Borders tonight. The Delta Airlines jet that crash landed in Toronto last month showed a rapid decrease in altitude as it approached the runway. That's accord to a report from the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, which is investigating the incident that left 21 people hospitalized. More than 67,000 white South Africans have expressed interest in gaining refugee status in the United States. It's part of President Trump's plan to relocate members of a white minority group. He claims the Afrikaners are victims of racial discrimination by their black led government and that they are having their farmland seized. The South African government says President Trump's claims are largely driven by misinformation. And this is a live look at Germany. One of the big stories there tonight, the Berlin Zoo's twin panda cubs explore their outdoor enclosure for the first time. Seven-month-old Leni and Lotti climbed trees, rocks, and platforms. The twins were born in August to two pandas on loan from China since 2017 under a 15 year agreement. Just some other stories Beyond our Borders tonight. We'll be right back ? tonight. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Prosecutors are requesting to present new evidence in the trial of the man accused of killing four University of Idaho students. Prosecutors filed a motion to release a photo Bryan Kohberger took of himself hours after the killings. A housemate claimed the suspect in their house had bushy eyebrows. Prosecutors hope to ask the jury if the photo matches that description. They are also requesting to share Kohberger's Amazon shopping data which they say show a knife was purchased before the homicides. One of the first questions you get asked as a new parent is what you plan to name your child. A hospital network in New Jersey is taking its infant identity data to a new level. Correspondent Dan Springer reports on a controversial new questionnaire that some New Jersey parents were not expecting. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) DAN SPRINGER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Becoming a new parent is always a time of enormous change. But now in New Jersey, some moms and dads are being asked to fill out a sexual orientation and gender identity questionnaire for their baby. It asks parents, ""Do you identify your baby as female, male, transgender, gender queer, or something else?"" And then there is this, which of the following best describes your baby, lesbian or gay, straight or heterosexual, bisexual or questioning unsure?"" HOLLY SCHEPISI, (R) NEW JERSEY STATE SENATOR: It's completely and utterly insane, and I think in New Jersey a very big litmus of showing how insane some of these policies are. SPRINGER: This questionnaire is being given to new parents at several hospitals run by Inspira Health Network in southern New Jersey. But other hospitals are collecting similar data on newborns. It's apparently all in response to a state law passed in 2022 requiring healthcare providers to collect race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and gender identity in a culturally competent and sensitive manner. Parents can refuse to answer the questions. But Republicans say the law should only apply to adults. One of the sponsors seems to agree. Democratic congressman Herbert Conaway, who worked on the bill when he was in the state house, tells FOX News, quote, ""Parents who are welcoming newborns into the world should be focused on their baby, not answering a questionnaire about sex or identity. This bill should never have been applied in this way."" (END VIDEO TAPE) SPRINGER (on camera): Inspira Health appears to have gotten the message. A company official tells us they will update their protocol after getting new guidance from the state health department. The sexual orientation and gender identity data will only be collected on health patients. Bret? BAIER: Dan, thank you. Ahead of the National Medal of Honor Museum opening next week in Texas, recipients were honored in the Washington area this afternoon. Correspondent Griff Jenkins spoke with one recipient who served in the Vietnam War about their heroic acts. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAJ. GEN. PATRICK HENRY BRADY (RET), U.S. ARMY: This medal does not make us special but it allows to us do special things. Nothing we have ever done is more special than that museum. The museum is going to focus on the value side of valor. Valor is finite. Values are infinite. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Out of the 3,500 Medal of Honor recipients, just 61 are still living. The Medal of Honor Museum opens Tuesday. Up next, the panel on President Trump's efforts to close the Department of Education, my interview with Secretary McMahon of that agency. First, here is what some of our FOX affiliates around the country are covering tonight. FOX 5 in Atlanta, where two brothers of the Venezuelan man convicted in the murder of Laken Riley will be deported along with their former roommate. Federal officials say the three men pleaded guilty to possessing fake green cards. FOX 2 in Detroit, a suspect is in custody following a hospital shooting and manhunt north of the city. Police say the altercation involved two hospital employees. A 25-year-old victim is recovering after being shot in the arm. And this is a live look at Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, from FOX 25, our affiliate there. One of the big stories there tonight, William Chisholm is the new majority owner of the Boston Celtics. The Massachusetts native is the co-founder of the Symphony Technology Group and purchased the team for $6.1 billion. It's the large sale of a franchise in the four major North American sports. That's tonight's live look outside the beltway from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: Those are two stats you don't want, the most money spent per pupil and you are at the bottom of the list. And that's where we are, like it or not. We are going to be returning education very simply back to the states where it belongs. RANDI WEINGARTEN, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN FEDERATION OF TEACHERS: The real issue is, how do we make sure that kids have the funding that they need? What are we saying to parents? What are we saying to the public? KAROLINE LEAVITT, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: We don't need to be spending more than $3 trillion over the course of a few decades on a department that's clearly failing,. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Well, the president signing the executive order to begin dismantling the Department of Education. The Senate minority leader quickly putting a post out, ""This is a horrible decision by Donald Trump, and it will be felt by teachers, parents, school leaders, and the quality of education our children receive. Across the country, property taxes will go up while the quality of many schools ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 EDUCATION SECRETARY: I think he was correct in saying that we were going to do everything legally. That's what he has said to me from the very beginning. He would like me to move as swiftly as we can because he believes the sooner that we can close the department, the more efficiently we can have the funds distributed to the states. I want Congress to be a partner in this, and I believe they will be, because both sides of the aisle know that what is happening to education in our country cannot be allowed to stand, because we are failing our students. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: So with that, let's bring in our panel, Democratic campaign consultant Kevin Walling, Kimberley Strassel," a member of the editorial board at """"The Wall Street Journal", and Roger Zakheim is the Washington director of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute. Kimberley, your thoughts on this, the process and what is behind it. Obviously, President Trump as a candidate campaigned on this pretty vigorously. KIMBERLEY STRASSEL," """"WALL STREET JOURNAL"""": Yes", it's a great first start. But now comes the hard work, and that comes in a couple of different ways. One is this administration is going to have to double down now on explaining what this means. You saw the criticism from Chuck Schumer, property taxes will go up, Randi Weingarten, terrible for kids. They need to explain their goal here is not cutting money. It's, instead, about giving it to the schools, for instance in block grants and ways that they can use to actually hire more teachers instead of hiring a bunch of midlevel managers who exist to try to apply for grants from the Department of Education. And then the second bit is they are going to have to partner with Congress, because if you really want to see that come into fruition, it is going to need to be done with Congress's effort, in particular in changing, for instance, the way all that works to establish block grants, or also to deal with the other huge part of the Department of Education which is $1.6 trillion in liabilities in student loans, which needs to be rationalized. BAIER: Kevin, you know, change is hard. Big change is harder. Explaining all of this in a way that people fully understand it, if you look at our latest FOX News poll just out on this specific question of closing down the Department of Education, you know, there is a lot of opposition. All voters at 65 percent. You can see Republicans favor it at 63. But look at independents on the opposition at 81 percent. I think there are a lot of questions and uncertainty in how it all plays out factored into this polling question. KEVIN WALLING, DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGN CONSULTANT: Yes, exactly right, Bret. I agree with Kimberley, the burden is now on the Trump White House to explain their plans going forward, and Secretary McMahon identify that. The fact that two thirds of Americans don't agree on much, but the fact that in this FOX polling they agree that the Department of Education should not be shuttered. Of course, as you point out, too, Bret, 81 percent of independents and a third of Republicans believe that. So certainly the burden is on this Trump White House to say OK, over these next four years we are going to dismantle this federal agency. Where is the money going? Obviously, a lot of it is relegated to special education, enforcing civil rights, Pell grants. There's a lot more details out there that we need that are very light on this executive action so far. BAIER: Roger, President Reagan wanted to eliminate the Department of Education, scale it back. His Education Secretary, Bill Bennett, was on FOX & FRIENDS this morning. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BILL BENNETT, FORMER EDUCATION SECRETARY: I would actually go one better, one tougher than the president. Instead of just sending it back to the states, send it back to the people. Do you really want to give 15 percent of your grants to the state of California and say do with this whatever you want? I don't think so. Why not send it directly to the people and let them in the form of scholarships or grants or vouchers, whatever you want to call them, us it to take it to the school of their choice? (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: And you heard me ask the secretary about that. You know, I put up that poll about the opposition to break up the Department of Education, or questions about it. If you look at the Gallup poll out just recently about the quality of public education, dissatisfied at 73 percent, Roger. ROBERT ZAKHEIM, RONALD REAGAN INSTITUTE: Secretary Bennett is getting at the key point is you could push the states you will end up having the same result. That's the problem. And so I think that's the challenge for the secretary of education. You mentioned President Reagan wanted to do this, and he talked as late as 1983 about abolishing the Department of Education. And the principle that was guiding his view is that he said education wasn't even just about going to the states. It should be managed by the home. And that's where I think Secretary Bennett was going as well. What you get with that is a real division over how you solve this problem. You had governors in the room today, lots of governors in Washington applauding this decision, but there are a lot of people from the homeschooling communities, the school choice community and other that say, hey, this is not something we want states to handle. We want families to handle this. How the secretary of education manages that will actually determine the speed in which she carries out President Trump's executive order. So what have you here is a challenge both on policy as well as the process which Kim emphasized earlier on, which is Congress, of course, because all these things are authorized in statute, is going to have to play a big part in figuring out what the next era looks like for the Department of Education. BAIER: Yes. Kimberley, I want to talk about the process on this legal battle between these district judges who are making rulings dealing with a whole bunch of different policy issues. During this show, President Trump put out a Truth Social post on nationwide injunctions," saying """"Unlawful nationwide injunctions by radical left judges could very well lead to the destruction of our country. These people are lunatics who do not care even a little bit about the repercussions from their very dangerous and incorrect decisions and rulings. If Justice Roberts and the United States Supreme Court do not fix this toxic and unprecedented situation immediately"," our country is in very serious trouble."""" Obviously", this is brewing to be a major battle legally and how the administration deals with some of these rulings from these district judges. STRASSEL: You know, this has actually been a big problem for a long time, Bret. It's just that it's now finally coming to a head. Bill Barr gave a speech back in 2019 noting that in the entire 20th century there were fewer than 30 national injunctions. You had 64 against Donald Trump in his first term alone. And that's going to look puny by comparison to what is being issued now. And justices like Clarence Thomas have been asking the court to address this and put out guidelines and clarify the limits of judicial power when it comes to these injunctions for a long time. He has been joined by Gorsuch, more recently by Alito in doing something. And the court has not moved. So, now, it's being asked to do so specifically. I don't see how it can avoid it anymore. But something needs to change. BAIER: Yes, Kevin, you heard the president say to Laura Ingraham, he is not going to disobey a legal order. However, he is challenging the fact that the power of a federal district judge is greater than the mandate of the executive branch that was elected by the people. WALLING: Yes, Bret, we live in a system of law and justice and Article III, and a check on both the legislature and executive departments. And I am heartened by the president in that conversation with Laura Ingraham saying that he will abide by those rulings. Now, he can vent his frustrations on Truth Social all he wants, but we'll see how the process plays out. BAIER: Yes, what he says in posts is different than what he does sometimes, and that's what you have to look at. WALLING: Exactly. BAIER: Panel, thank you. WALLING: Thanks, Bret. BAIER: And finally tonight, a special day. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's 122 meters, a white card. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Look at this, a Russian free diver is believed in have set a new world record in under ice swimming. Forget it. A Russian media broadcast reports she swam about 400 feet in under two minutes under the icy surface of a lake near Russia's border with Mongolia. That is a cold plunge. She swam without a wetsuit, used only her legs to propel her forward. Congratulations, I guess. Tomorrow on SPECIAL REPORT, we continue our series about the five-year anniversary of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Is that OK? WATTERS: Sorry, very sorry. BAIER: OK. All right. Thanks. Good evening. I'm Bret Baier, after the blow up at the White House, will the U.S. continue to supply weapons and money to Ukraine? We'll take a look. Border agents arrest suspects accused of bringing into the U.S. tens of thousands of illegal immigrants from one particular country. And wildfires burned through parts of South Carolina. We'll take you there for a live report. But first, breaking tonight, the fallout keeps coming from Friday's explosive White House exchange between President Trump and Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a rare earths mineral deal still up in the air, but the president is announcing a major international agreement on computer chip manufacturing. Meanwhile, Wall Street markets experience a major selloff today after the president's announcement about impending tariffs on Canada and Mexico, he says tariffs announced earlier will take effect within hours. The Dow shaken, lost 650, the S&P 500 fell 105, the NASDAQ plummet plummeted 497 today, and that is where we begin tonight. Senior White House Correspondent Peter Doocy starts us off live from the North Lawn. Good evening, Peter. PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. The Dow, dropping 649 points today shows that markets at this point don't like the uncertainty that comes along with these new 25 percent tariffs on key trading partners, Canada and Mexico, as President Trump rules out an 11th hour deal. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: No room left for Mexico or for Canada. The tariffs, you know, they're all set. They go into effect tomorrow. Vast amounts of fentanyl have poured into our country from Mexico, and as you know, also from China, where it goes to Mexico and goes to Canada. DOOCY: Here at the White House, we are also being told by a senior administration official that it is very unlikely at this point that anything is going to happen with the U.S.-Ukraine rare earth minerals deal until President Zelenskyy offers an explicit public apology. TRUMP: I just think you should be more appreciative, because this country has stuck with them through thick and thin. DOOCY (voice over): White House officials are still frustrated with Volodymyr Zelenskyy. KAROLINE LEAVITT, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: And he bit the hand that is feeding him. DOOCY (voice over): Now, openly speculating the Ukrainian people could soon move to replace him. TRUMP: If somebody doesn't want to make a deal, I think that person won't be around very long. DOOCY (voice over): Trump White House could also soon suspend military aid to Ukraine, but in the meantime, the focus is on the imperiled rare earth minerals deal. TRUMP: It's great for them, because they get us in the country taking the rare earth. DOOCY (voice over): Although Zelenskyy doesn't think Friday's Oval Office meeting changed anything. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): If we agree that it will be signed, from our side, we are ready to sign. I honestly think the United States will be ready as well. DOOCY (voice over): A lack of appreciation isn't Zelenskyy's only issue. Trump posted another quote that he thinks was the worst statement that could have been made by Zelenskyy. TRUMP: He said he thinks it was going to go on for a long time, and he better not be right about that. DOOCY (voice over): At the moment, Zelenskyy still has a few off ramps. DAN HOFFMAN, FORMER CIA CHIEF IF STATION: What he should be saying is that, of course, Ukraine wants peace. Ukraine never wanted this war, that Russia invaded Ukraine. He didn't do that, and that's another missed opportunity. I don't know how many of these he gets. DOOCY (voice over): Not many, according to the National Security Advisor. MIKE WALTZ, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: Time is not on his side. Time is not on the side of just forever continuing this conflict. The American people's patience is not unlimited. Their wallets are not unlimited. DOOCY (voice over): And that's why the Trump team will continue making direct outreach to Moscow. TRUMP: I think it takes two to tango, and you're going to have to make a deal with Russia, and you're going to have to make a deal with Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE) DOOCY (on camera): And we've got some new details tonight about the address President Trump plans to make to a joint session of Congress tomorrow. The theme overall is going to be renewal of the American dream. He will use the time to boast about $1.7 trillion in new private sector investment in the United States since he got back, and he is also going to take the opportunity to pressure lawmakers in the room to give him more money to address the southern border, Bret. BAIER: Peter Doocy live on the North Lawn. Peter, thanks. Senate Republicans are daring Democrats to block a vote on legislation preventing biological males from competing in female sports. That comes up later. President Trump's pick to run and possibly dismantle the Education Department is up for confirmation now. Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram is on Capitol Hill tonight with the latest. Good evening, Chad. CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Bret, good evening. The vote is still open, but the Senate is about to confirm Linda McMahon as education secretary. The vote right now 43 to 23, this would be the 20th major confirmation of a Trump administration official. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SEN. JOHN THUNE (R-SD): And I look forward to working with Linda McMahon to limit bureaucracy, empower state and local governments and let good teachers do what they're best at and what they love to do, and that's to help students succeed. PERGRAM: Now, the vote bewilders Democrats, especially since the President wants to eliminate the Education Department. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): I'm very proud that every single Democrat will vote against Ms. McMahon. Ms. McMahon's confirmation would be a slap in the face to students, parents, teachers, who care about our public schools. PERGRAM (voice over): Next up, a test vote on a bill by Alabama Republican Tommy Tuberville. It would ban those born as males from competing in women's sports. Democrats will block the bill with a filibuster. SEN. TOMMY TUBERVILLE (R-AL): We have to get back to common sense in this country. SEN. BRIAN SCHATZ (D-HI): Trans people are not the reason people can't afford groceries or health care or housing. PERGRAM (voice over): Another Democratic rally against DOGE today. Maxine Waters of California led a protest against cuts at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Waters says an aide to HUD secretary, Scott Turner prevented her from delivering a letter. SEN. MARK WARNER (D-VA): We're telling people and showing people about our power, and this is what we say, when we fight, we can win. When we fight, we can win. When we fight, we can win. And now we say to Trump and Elon, are you ready for this fight? (END VIDEOTAPE) PERGRAM (on camera): Multiple Democrats will bring fired federal workers as their guests to the president's speech to Congress tomorrow night, Bret. BAIER: Complete coverage here on Fox News Channel. Chad, thank you. The question of whether President Trump can fire the head of the Special Counsel's Office is likely headed to the U.S. Supreme Court tonight, and it could have plenty of company. The p resident's efforts to reduce the federal payroll are being met with all sorts of legal and public challenges. Chief Washington Correspondent Mike Emanuel has details tonight. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Protesters gather outside U.S. district court in Washington ahead of a critical hearing about the Trump administration's efforts to make major cuts at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Inside U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson said she's trying to get a clear picture of what is going on inside the agency. The judge, while skeptical of the government's claim of executive authority telling both sides, ""elections have consequences, and it's not for me to get in the middle and tell the government how to run an agency."" THOMAS DUPREE, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL: At the end of the day, it's going to be largely speed bumps and their courts are not going to prevent the Trump administration from trying to dramatically reduce the size of the federal workforce. EMANUEL (voice over): Judge Jackson is also handling another case, a constitutional fight about whether President Trump can fire anyone he wants working inside the executive branch. Hampton Dellinger is the head of the Office of Special Counsel. His attorney argues Dellinger has a five year term under law and that his termination is unlawful since the Office of Special Counsel is independent. On Saturday, Jackson ruled against the government, allowing Dellinger to remain in his job. She has called this, ""an extraordinarily difficult constitutional issue."" The Trump administration immediately started the appeals process. ILYA SHAPIRO, MANHATTAN INSTITUTE: Proactive Trump administration litigation against some of these civil service rules, tying the president's hands, union contracts in the -- in the public sector might violate executive control over the executive branch. (END VIDEOTAPE) EMANUEL (on camera): There are now about 100 federal lawsuits against Trump's policies, with 21 rulings already blocking the president's moves, at least temporarily. Much of this is likely heading to the Supreme Court in the months ahead, Bret. BAIER: Mike, thank you. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WALTZ: The president campaigned on ending this war. He was elected to end this war. He will be the peacemaker in chief. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It wasn't Zelenskyy who was the dictators. MARCO RUBIO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Zelenskyy did, unfortunately, is he found every opportunity to try to Ukraine-splain on every issue. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The White House has become an arm of the Kremlin. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I thought that, you know, politics stops at the water's edge. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Well, that's a little back and forth over the fallout from the meeting between Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and President Trump in the Oval Office. Now what? Let's bring in Fox News Chief Political Analyst Brit Hume. Brit, good evening. How do you see this? You've heard what Zelenskyy said overseas and what the president has reacted to that. BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, he uttered a number of expressions of gratitude to the United States, something he has done in the past which might have been enough if he had done that in that meeting. But once the meeting ended and the administration officials, the president, vice president, Secretary of State, were so plainly offended by what they heard and by what they didn't hear, that the price went up. And now the demand, as was reported earlier, and as you know, is for a full-fledged on camera apology. And Zelenskyy, whose pride is no small thing, is reluctant to do that. And unless and until he does, the end of this impasse is not easy to see. So, I think we're in a spot here. They may find some way to do it. Diplomatic language would be useful, if somebody could think of any. But I think Zelenskyy may have been bred a very brave and effective wartime leader for his country, rallying his forces against pretty long odds, particularly in the war. What he has not shown is that he's much of a diplomat, and he needs, I think he needs to get to work on that to get this impasse resolved. BAIER: Yes, and is your sense do you think this rare earth mineral deal is eventually going to happen? HUME: Well, I think it's certainly worth pursuing. I think the administration wants it. What I think the lens key is looking at here is he sees, yes, it might be a deterrent to Russia to Putin, to have American businessmen and personnel on the ground, digging and moving these minerals and so on, and executives and people making deals and so on in Kyiv and elsewhere. But I think he thinks it won't be enough. And so far, so far, President Trump has not offered anything further than that, or any promises of anything further than that. Now, the Europeans are getting together now and starting to talk about it. You know, Keir Starmer of Britain and France's (ph), I mean and -- BAIER: Emmanuel Macron. HUME: French President Macron. Macron has -- they've talked about the willingness to send troops and that would be interesting if it were to happen, but it hasn't really materialized yet. So I think that's where we are. And I think Zelenskyy, he's afraid of getting left at the gate with no real security guarantees. And I can understand the worry. He just handled it badly. BAIER: Yes. And speaking of worry, there's worry on Wall Street, some jittery feelings, the market didn't handle things well today on a number of different fronts. Here's the president talking about the tariffs on Canada and Mexico. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is there any room left for Canada and Mexico to make a deal before midnight? And should we expect those Chinese tariffs, the extra 10 percent? TRUMP: No room left for Mexico or for Canada. No, the tariffs, you know, they're all set. They go into effect tomorrow. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: So, a lot of people thought that that was it. But then the Atlanta Fed had a GDP now model estimating annualized growth in the current quarter at minus 2.8 percent today, down from plus 2.3 percent last week. A month ago, that model showed plus 4.0, you know, we've seen those fluctuations before, but that, I think, added to the jitters on Wall Street. HUME: Yes, that's a pretty striking fluctuation for the Atlanta Fed there, Bret, you know, from a -- from a plus four to a minus 2.8 percent that's -- you know, that would rattle -- if I were -- if I were heavily in the market. I'd be rattled by that too, not to mention, probably, to some extent, at least, a reflection of the -- of the tariffs going into effect, and the fear that it will stifle commerce among these three countries and lead to a down quarter. So, the worry is understandable. But of course, you know, we probably get up tomorrow morning, there'll be a huge rally. So, you know, that's what these things tend to happen. BAIER: You never know. You never know. Brit, as always. Thank you. HUME: Buy and hold. BAIER: Up next, a wildfire burns through an area near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. We'll take you there for a live report. First, Beyond our Borders tonight, police in Germany say a driver rammed a car into a crowd in the city of Manheim. Two people were killed, several others injured. A suspect is now in custody. Police would not immediately characterize that incident as a terrorist attack. Mourners in Israel attend the last of the funerals for eight hostages whose bodies were returned from Gaza during the first phase of the cease fire. Crowds line the long route of the funeral procession for this one hostage who was 68 when he was abducted from his home by Hamas terrorists. The Vatican says Pope Francis has suffered two new episodes of acute respiratory crisis. He has been put back on noninvasive mechanical ventilation. It's the latest setback in what has become a more than two week battle to overcome a complex respiratory infection and pneumonia. The progress still remains guarded tonight. And this is a live look at Slovenia, one of the big stories there tonight. Their northern neighbors' new government has taken office. Christian Stocker is the new Austrian Chancellor. He is head of a previously untried three-party coalition coming to power, after a record five month wait for a new administration in Austria. Just some of the other stories, ""BEYOND OUR BORDERS"" tonight. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: First Lady Melania Trump, spoke on Capitol Hill today for the first time since returning to the White House. She participated in a round table discussion with lawmakers from both chambers of commerce -- Congress focused on legislation, punishing online abuse, and revenge pornography. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MELANIA TRUMP, FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES: It's heartbreaking to witness young teens, especially girls, grappling with the overwhelming challenges posed by malicious online content. We must prioritize their well-being by equipping them with support and tools necessary to navigate this hostile digital landscape. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: The so-called Take It Down bill, passed unanimously in the Senate, it is now before the House. ""BREAKING TONIGHT"", South Carolina is dealing with a wildfire outbreak. One particular blaze is causing major problems. Investigators are trying to figure out who or what may be behind these fires. Jonathan Serrie is in Horry County, South Carolina tonight, with the latest. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): At least 163 wildfires have scorched more than 5400 acres across South Carolina's parks wilderness over the past seven days. Firefighters got all but one under control. The Covington Drive Fire in Horry County, just outside Myrtle Beach, has been burning since Saturday. RUSSELL HUBRIGHT, SPOKESPERSON, SOUTH CAROLINA FORESTRY COMMISSION: We're not sure of the cause yet. That's under investigation. A lot of our fires, unfortunately in South Carolina, are caused by people. Over 60 percent are caused by people doing some kind of burning, like burning yard debris. SERRIE (voice over): The risk is so serious, Governor Henry McMaster, warns anyone violating a statewide ban on outdoor burning will go to jail. Over the weekend, aircraft dumped water on a massive set of flames, threatening Horry County's Carolina forest community, saving homes in the fire's path. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's been surreal. I mean, they keep popping up, these little things do, and you don't know if they're going to come into your house or the next neighbor's house, or it's just a thought, I just really scares me. SERRIE (voice over): Meanwhile, in North Carolina, a fire continues to burn in the western mountains, a region still cleaning up from remnants of Hurricane Helene that toppled trees and caused catastrophic floods back in September. JEREMY WALDROP, NORTH CAROLINA FOREST SERVICE: There are challenges were a lot of steep, slippery terrain, a lot of downfall from the storm that we're having to work through and deal with and work the fire around that as well. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think we all know that Western Carolina has -- and I think South Carolina too, we've all been through the wringer. (END VIDEOTAPE) SERRIE (on camera): Yes, indeed, they have. So far, there have been no reports of injuries or any significant damage to homes or businesses, largely to the credit of these firefighters, who have been contending with heavy winds in recent days. They could find some relief mid-week with rain in the forecast. Bret? BAIER: Jonathan Serrie in South Carolina. Jonathan, thank you. Up next, a human smuggling operation may have brought at least 20,000 people from one country into the U.S. We'll have specifics.

A lunar lander built in Central Texas has reached the moon. The Blue Ghost touched down Sunday morning. It's the first successful commercial lunar landing. It completed a 45-day trip from Florida, which included several orbits around the Earth. That's tonight's live look ""OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY"" from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: ""BREAKING TONIGHT"", federal agents have two people in custody, accused of leading a human smuggling operation that has brought tens of thousands of Guatemalans into the U.S. since 2019. Senior correspondent Alicia Acuna has the latest tonight from Denver. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOSEPH MCNALLY, ACTING UNITED STATES ATTORNEY: This organization caused deaths. ALICIA ACUNA, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Federal authorities in Los Angeles announced the takedown of a Guatemalan criminal organization responsible for one of the largest human smuggling operations in the United States. On Friday, agents arrested Eduardo Domingo Renoj-Matul and Cristobal Mejia-Chaj, both illegal immigrants from Guatemala, for allegedly moving more than 20,000 migrants into the U.S. since 2019. The Border Patrol says agents noticed illegal Guatemalan immigrants being transported with large amounts of cash. GREGORY BOVINO, U.S. BORDER PATROL: This was more than just a regional struggling organization. This was complex coast-to-coast smuggling organization. ACUNA: Authorities say the group charged migrants up to $18,000 to get from Guatemala to the Arizona border. The smugglers would then hold the migrants in stash houses in Phoenix and Los Angeles before relocating them around the country, often keeping migrants hostage for months in this L.A. neighborhood if they didn't pay the transport fees. Also charged Jose Paxtor-Oxlaj who is already behind bars for killing seven immigrants including three children in a 2023 car crash in Oklahoma that happened during a transport from New York to Los Angeles. Another suspect, Helmer Obispo-Hernandez is on the run after authorities say he threatened to kill a federal agent. MCNALLY: While search warrants were being executed in Los Angeles on Friday, he telephoned a member of the investigative team and threatened to kill that agent and his family members by cutting off their heads. (END VIDEO TAPE) ACUNA (on camera): The three suspects in custody are being held without bond and face the death penalty if convicted. Bret? BAIER: Alicia, thank you. President Trump is highlighting a massive drop in illegal border crossings during his first full month in office. But immigration enforcement leaders are concerned over leaks that may be giving people in the country illegally warnings of impending raids. Here is senior national correspondent Rich Edson. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS STATE DEPARTMENT CORRESPONDENT: Immigration activists are working to disrupt government deportation raids. The latest posts revealing details about ICE operations today and tomorrow in northern Virginia. JONATHAN FAHEY, FORMER HOMELAND SECURITY DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY: People can be charged with obstruction of justice, and it's really justified here because these agents that are going out there on behalf of us to keep us safer are being put in danger because of these leakers trying to advance their political agenda. EDSON: Attorney General Pam Bondi says the Justice Department is investigating the leaks. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem has vowed to use polygraphs to try identify those responsible. Last month border czar Tom Homan blamed leakers for hampering an operation near Denver. TOM HOMAN, WHITE HOUSE BORDER CZAR: It's only a matter time if we walk into a place where there's going to bad guy doesn't care, he's going to be sitting in wait for the officers to show up and ambush him. This is not a game. EDSON: Preliminary government data show Border Patrol apprehended fewer than 8,500 migrants last month at the southern border, the lowest since officials began keeping monthly records 25 years ago. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: U.S. Border Patrol has always known how to security border. But the last administration didn't want to listen. EDSON: Some Democrats are criticizing the administration's methods and say Republicans should negotiate a bipartisan border bill. SEN. MARK KELLY, (D-AZ): The numbers being down, that's a good thing. What the administration is doing, especially with ICE raids in schools, with flying, repatriating people who often aren't only criminals in military airplanes for intimidation, talking about housing people in Guantanamo, that's for intimidation. (END VIDEO TAPE) EDSON (on camera): Last month ICE disputed that there were raids in schools. Over the past several months, Mexican authorities have stepped up immigration enforcement, apprehending migrants before they even reached the U.S. border. After tariff threats from President Trump, the Mexican government also dispatched 10,000 more troops to patrol the border. Bret? BAIER: Rich, thanks. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says he is deeply concerned about the ongoing measles outbreak in several states. The Texas Department of State Health Services reports 146 confirmed measles cases in Texas since last January. There has been one death. Kennedy has an op-ed on FOXnews.com now. He is directing federal health agencies to work with state officials in Texas. He tells parents to consult with healthcare providers about vaccines. He writes, quote, ""Vaccines not only protect individual children from measles but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons."" Kennedy, of course, had come under fire from critics over past comments expressing skepticism over vaccines. Boston's Democratic mayor is receiving criticism tonight for offering condolences over the death of a man who investigators say was chasing people with a knife and then was fatally shot by police. Correspondent Molly Line has the latest tonight from Boston. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) MOLLY LINE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Surveillance video capturing the moment terrified patrons flee a Chick-fil-A in the heart of Boston just days before Mayor Michelle Wu heads to Washington to testify in front of Congress and defend Boston, which she says is the safest major city in the country. The Democrat is facing fresh backlash at home for sympathy expressed first for an accused knife wielding assailant instead of the off- duty police officer who investigators say fired his weapon to stop a threat as two people fleeing the man sought safety in the restaurant Saturday afternoon. MICHELLE WU, (D) BOSTON MAYOR: My condolences and all of our thoughts are with the family of the individual whose life has been lost. I'm glad that the officer is safe, and very grateful for a quick response. LINE: Among those quickly slamming Wu, South Carolina Republican Congresswoman Nancy Mace who sits on the House Oversight Committee for which Wu will testify on Wednesday. Mace writing, ""Condolences from the mayor of Boston, wait for it, to a knife-wielding man trying to kill people. Thankfully this guy was stopped in his tracks by a brave law enforcement officer."" Today, after reading to children, Wu tried to turn the page, noting both the local D.A. and Boston's top cop expressed their condolences as well, pushing back on critics. WU: It's unfortunate to politicize being at the scene of a tragic incident. We had an off-duty officer who saw something happening, his training kicked in, and took action, and surely saved even more lives. (END VIDEO TAPE) LINE (on camera): The suspect killed was identified today as Lamar, 32, a U.S. citizen from Boston. But this hearing slated for Wednesday is expected to focus on sanctuary city policies. Mayor Wu says she acknowledges that this is being painted as a bit of a showdown, but this is not her first rodeo and she expects to go down there and defend this diverse city. Bret? BAIER: Molly Line, live in Boston. Molly, thanks. Moments ago, the U.S. Senate confirmed Linda McMahon as education secretary 51 to 45. McMahon is slated to take that oath of office and getting a position where she is going to be instructed to try to dismantle the Education Department, but she gets the vote 51-45. Up next, the panel on the latest fallout from Friday's White House encounter between President Trump and Ukraine's leader and what comes next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: I just think he should be more appreciative, because this country has stuck with them through thick and thin. And if somebody doesn't want to make a deal, I think that person won't be around very long. SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN, (D-MD) SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE: I don't think we should expect foreign leaders to have to come into the Oval Office and play dear leader like the president's cabinet officials and others may be doing. MIKE WALTZ, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: You heard the president. Both sides are going to have to make compromises. We are ready to enter into those negotiations. Is President Zelenskyy? (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: So what comes next after that meeting on Friday, all that has been said over the weekend? Well, an A.P. headline really caught some attention, ""Ukraine's Zelenskyy says end of war with Russia is very, very far away."" That prompted President Trump to respond on Truth Social, saying ""That's the worst statement that could have been made by Zelenskyy and America will not put up with it for much longer. It is what I was saying. This guy doesn't want there to be peace as long as he has America's backing, and Europe in the meeting with Zelenskyy stated flatly that they cannot do the job without the U.S. Probably not a great statement to have been made in terms of a show of strength against Russia. What are they thinking?"" With that, let's bring in our panel tonight, Brian Kilmeade, co-host of FOX & FRIENDS, ""Axios"" political reporter Stef Kight, and Leslie Marshall, Democratic strategist. Brian, what do you think? What do you make of all that's been said? And now they are considering whether to continue aid or not. BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, I think that, real quick, Zelenskyy has to get back to get this deal done. And whether he has to send another emissary there or whether they do some type of document where they can sign in different locations, they have to get this back going, because the Russians are playing this to their advantage. You see their report today, they say essentially in telling their people that America is in their court and wants to see Ukraine destroyed and wants to see Zelenskyy removed. I also think that as much as the French and the U.K. and the rest of Europe want to say we got your back, Zelenskyy knows the only people that can really have his back is the U.S. So I think cooler heads will prevail. I know we have the treasury secretary on tomorrow. He's still got that deal ready to go. And knowing that Trump doesn't mind going back after he fights with people or else he wouldn't basically have a cabinet -- at one point he fought with all of them -- I really think that there is light at the end of the tunnel to get that done, because it would be a true deterrent. BAIER: Yes. Stef, there is this sense that maybe Zelenskyy is ready to have the war continue, what he said over the weekend, how the president's interpreting that. I asked Zelenskyy on Friday on SPECIAL REPORT about that perception. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: President Trump is convinced that you will never sign a deal with Vladimir Putin. Is he right? VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT: No. I think, so -- what I think, Ukraine wants peace and we will have -- we will have any way diplomacy. We will have negotiations. We have to be very strong at the table of negotiations, and at these negotiations, Ukraine and Russia like sides of this war have to be and the United States and Europe. That's what I said. So we are ready for peace, but we have to be in a strong position. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: So that was his answer then. And then over the weekend Secretary of State Rubio was asked a similar question about this minerals deal. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARCO RUBIO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: I hope this could all be reset. I hope he comes to the realization that we are actually trying to help his country before it suffers thousands of more casualties. The argument that we are going to just keep it going forever",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 if it's even possible, and see if there is a way forward that ends this conflict and make sure it never happens again. That's our goal. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Stef, what are you hearing on the Hill and from the White House on this? STEF KIGHT, POLITICAL REPORTER," """"AXIOS"""": I mean", on the Hill there was shock after Friday's meeting. People really feel like it made a mess of negotiations on all sides. We have heard mostly frustration from Republicans towards Zelenskyy. But even some Republicans, some of the normal ones who are willing to criticize the president, have criticized the way that meeting was held. And it's clearly a mess right now. And we're seeing the president, President Trump is really focused on getting a deal as quickly as possible. That's really his emphasis. He has said for a long time now he wanted to end the war on day one. And the emphasis is on getting a deal no matter what. And of course, Zelenskyy is going to have concerns. He wants to make sure that the U.S. and European allies are ready to defend Ukraine against future Russian aggression. Meanwhile, Russia is kind of taking this and promoting it as saying the negotiations are moving in their favor, which again, just makes this an even messier situation. It's really hard to see a way forward. We do know that President Trump and Vice President Vance and other top national security officials have been meeting today to try to figure out what the path forward will be. We're still waiting to get kind of an idea of what that is going to look like. BAIER: Without the U.S. aid, Leslie, it is tough to see Europe holding its own alone supporting Ukraine. LESLIE MARSHALL, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Absolutely. But at the same time, when you have to look at and walk a mile in somebody else's shoes. Zelenskyy has seen more than 70,000 people in his country killed, and one would say murdered. I mean, this was an invasion of his country. They were sitting there minding their own business. And the optics are really bad here for the United States not only within our borders but throughout the world because it does look like our president, it does look like our Republican majority, it does look like many Americans are going yay, Putin. I remember when I was a kid and we were racing them to the moon because they weren't our ally, they were they enemy. Maybe they are not our enemy now, but they are not about freedom and democracy when we just look what they are doing in their country and what Putin has done. What has happened to us? And when we are asking somebody to wear a seat when Elon Musk doesn't, we're asking somebody to apologize between 33 and 94 times, excuse me, now I will apologize, has said thank you since February of 2022. And I'm old enough to remember, Bret, when Bibi Netanyahu was sitting there with Barack Obama and he really kept going. As a matter of fact Obama sat down, and when his Israel thanked us for all our help. So we are just getting off course here. And the president did say the war would end the first day of his presidency, and it hasn't. KILMEADE: You know, Bret, if you watch the whole 50 minutes -- BAIER: Brian, last word on this. Go ahead. KILMEADE: If you watch the whole 50 minutes, it started off as a very friendly press conference. He went astoundingly long, almost begging for some type of thing to go wrong and somebody to lose their temper. And I just find it amazing that Zelenskyy finds it amazing that he does not -- he wants everyone to realize they started this. They are killing our people. They cut deals in 97 and 2014, and broke all of them. They lied to Macron, they lied to everybody. And he's just trying to say, just understand, they're the ones with the bad track record. We are defending ourselves. I also think, it's just, if I'm Zelenskyy, get the ball to Putin. And then we will see how serious they are. Because you know the preliminary details of the Russia side, knock it down to 85,000 troops, make them have elections. We want more of their land for free, and they can never really armed forces or an air force again. Of course that wouldn't be acceptable. And we will see how sincere Vladimir Putin is when Trump gets them both in a room where he says here is the Zelenskyy side, and now I need so see the Russian side. Right now there is no pressure on the Russians. BAIER: And it is amazing in that Oval Office question, it was the last question, the last question after all of that time, if you go back and look at the tape. All right, we've got some breaking news on the other side of the break. Up next, tomorrow's address to Congress from President Trump. We will look at the possibilities. And then a little later an NFL icon announces his departure. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Breaking tonight, a top FBI official has been pushed out of his job a month after the Trump administration removed senior leaders at the agency and requested the names of agents who worked on Capitol riot cases. Multiple reports now that the New York field office head of the FBI there, James Dennehy, had urged his employees to dig in following the administration's request. Dennehy said in an email to FBI in New York, he was informed he needed to put in his retirement papers Friday. He was not given a reason for the decision. There's some reporting it may have to deal with the Epstein documents that we have been following. Don't have that confirmed, but the head of the New York FBI has been pushed out of his job. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: I'm going to be making a speech. You probably heard about it tomorrow now. REP. MIKE JOHNSON, (R-LA) HOUSE SPEAKER: It actually will be more like a State of the Union address because President Trump has long series of victories, things that he has done, promises that he has kept, and it is putting America back on a strong footing, and we can't to wait welcome him back to the chamber. SEN. CHRIS MURPHY, (D-CT) SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE: I think it's going to be a MAGA pep rally, not a serious talk to the nation. I think Donald Trump is going to spew a series of lies. The case I'm making to Democrats is we have to fight every single day, every single day. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Well, we are getting ready for joint session address, not technically a State of the Union, Stef, but it seems like it will not be the traditional address from what we're hearing so far. KIGHT: Yes, I think we can expect Trump to come in ready to tout many of his actions he has taken so far. And he has moved quickly and we expect him to talk about the border and border numbers being down. We expect him to talk about no government spending action through DOGE and other issues. And we are expecting Democrats to boycott. There's a growing list of Democrats who are saying that they do not intend to actually show up tomorrow. BAIER: OK, some breaking news not, and it's likely going to be talked about in the speech tomorrow, Brian. Our Lucas Tomlinson reporting the United States is pausing all U.S. military aid to Ukraine until President Trump determines the Ukrainians show a commitment of good faith peace negotiations. That's according to a senior Trump administration telling FOX. This is not a permanent termination of aid. It is a pause. The orders are going out right now. The official said this in response to Ukrainian President Zelenskyy's conduct over the last week and his words over the weekend. So it's all stopping, Brian. KILMEADE: Yes, well, he needs an apology. President Trump says I need a direct apology. This could be fixed with a phone call. Sorry if things went off the rails, liked the first 45 minutes of our talk, didn't like the last 10. So let's get this thing back on track. I understand what you mean, and let's do it. And then you put the ball in Russia's court, and let's see how sincere they are. But it's going to take a call from Zelenskyy to Trump directly. And I'm sure he would take the call. The guy does not hold grudges. BAIER: Leslie, this is going to be part of that speech. Democrat, some of them saying they are going to boycott the speech. How do you think this all plays? MARSHALL: I'm not a big fan of boycotts. I'm also not a big fan of pre- rebuttal. Let's see what the guy has to say. Show up, that's what people vote for you to do. And, by the way, when is Putin going to apologize to Zelenskyy for invading his sovereign nation? Just wondering. KILMEADE: True. Absolutely you're right. BAIER: There you go. Panel, thanks so much. See you tomorrow. And finally tonight, a special day. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JIMMY JOHNSON, FOX SPORTS: The most fun I have ever had in my career, and that's counting Super Bowl and national championships, was at FOX Sports. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Coaching and broadcasting icon Jimmy Johnson is retiring from his job with FOX Sports. Johnson has been with the network for, get this, 31 years. Before that, he won two Super Bowls as the head coach of the Dallas Cowboys. Johnson made that announcement while appearing on a sports talk show today. He called his time a great run and said he is going to miss it. If you haven't watched FOX on the football coverage, he has been an icon from the very beginning. We're going to miss Jim Johnson.

We still have time to spare. Bret? BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: You know he was blond before that. Good evening. Welcome to Washington. I'm Bret Baier. A House Oversight Subcommittee on the Department of Government Efficiency holds its first hearing. New statistics from immigration officials showing reports of gotaways are at some of their lowest levels in recent years. And a new inflation report shows consumer prices rose more than expected in January. But first, breaking tonight, President Donald Trump says he is backing Ukraine, while promising to work closely with Russian President Vladimir Putin on a peace deal to end the war between the two countries. He spoke with the leaders from both nations today on the telephone, before telling reporters in the Oval Office that Europe needs to do more to address the conflict. European leaders say they want to work with the U.S. on Ukraine's future, as some call for Kyiv to join the NATO Alliance, a move the Trump administration opposes. Let's head to the North Lawn where senior White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich reports on President Trump's two long distance calls today. Important ones. Good evening, Jacqui. JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. The president's calls this morning officially kicked off these peace talks, But Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth made some big news ahead of it in a speech at NATO Headquarters overnight, appearing to rule out NATO's member -- Ukraine's rather, membership in NATO as a part of any negotiated settlement, as well as NATO troops playing any role in future peacekeeping. It was pretty unclear all day if that was President Trump's position as well, until he confirmed it in the Oval Office as the new DNI Tulsi Gabbard was just sworn in. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think we're on the way to getting peace. I think President Putin wants peace and President Zelenskyy wants peace and I want peace. HEINRICH (voice over): President Trump expressing optimism after long calls with Russian President Putin, then Ukrainian President Zelenskyy this morning, but in the next breath, Trump casually indicating a reversal of U.S. policy is ahead. Since the Bush administration, the U.S. has supported Ukraine's future in NATO and the alliance's open door policy, but the Secretary of Defense said today that's unrealistic in a negotiated settlement to end the war. TRUMP: Probably that's true. They've been saying that for a long time that Ukraine cannot go into NATO and I'm OK with that. HEINRICH (voice over): Trump says no preconditions were set to begin peace talks, but the Kremlin readout of the call indicates Putin again set a red line on Ukraine joining NATO. ""Putin, for his part, mentioned the need to eliminate the root causes of the conflict."" Zelenskyy not feeding into criticism the White House put his country at a disadvantage by taking NATO membership off the table, long considered by Kyiv, the only way to deter future Russian aggression. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): We believe that America's power is enough to together with us, together with all partners, pressure Russia and Putin towards peace. HEINRICH (voice over): Trump says he'll play a heavy role in the negotiations TRUMP: I'll be dealing with President Putin, largely on the phone, and we ultimately expect to meet. In fact, we expect that he'll come here and I'll go there, and we're going to meet, also, probably in Saudi Arabia. HEINRICH (voice over): Treasury Secretary Scott Besson, also playing a role in Ukraine right now, pitching a deal to continue U.S. military support, but extract rare earth minerals in exchange. TRUMP: We want it secured, and the money is going to be secured, because if we didn't do that, then Putin would say he won. (END VIDEOTAPE) HEINRICH (on camera): The president is expected to sign several executive orders tonight, including reciprocal tariffs for any country that charges the U.S. That would have big implications for countries like India, whose prime minister is heading here tomorrow to meet with President Trump and is expected to announce his own rate cuts ahead of that meeting, Bret. BAIER: Thanks, Jacqui. As President Trump calls for negotiations to end the RussiaUkraine war, let's take a look at the evolution of the historically contentious borders between the two countries. Ukraine was under Soviet control from the early 1920s until gaining its full independence when the USSR dissolved in December of 1991. Now, Crimea, which is down here, this area here, voted to join the newly independent Ukraine. But maintained its own constitution and legislature. In November 2013 Ukraine was closing in on an agreement with the European Union to integrate political and economic ties. However, that did not happen. Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych halted that deal due to pressure from Moscow, and there were all kinds of violent protests erupting Kyiv's Independence Square. Yanukovych actually fled to Russia as Ukraine devolved into chaos and pro-Russia protests increased in Crimea. So, fast forward to March 2014, Russian troops take control of these regions here, the Crimea region formally annexing the peninsula. Crimea gives Moscow critical critical access to the port city of Sevastopol, which is right here on the tip of Crimea. It serves as the headquarters to the RussianBlack Sea fleet. The international community never recognized this annexation, and that becomes part of the problem. In early of February 2022, that's when satellite imagery shows this large deployment of Russian troops to its border with Belarus, negotiations with the United States, other European nations, failed to deter Russia. And then on February 24, 2022, Vladimir Putin launches this full scale land, sea, air invasion across Ukraine. Since then, Ukraine has pushed back, but Russia has gained more than 26,000 square miles of territory. It currently occupies about 20 percent of Ukraine. If you look at all of this area here. And the question is, the Russian and Ukrainian militaries have reported hundreds of thousands of military casualties on both sides, experts say the fightings also resulted in more than 40,000 civilian casualties, and 6.8 million Ukrainians have fled since the start of the conflict. The question remains as to what Ukraine and its borders will look like when they return. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says Ukraine should abandon hopes to win all of this territory back. Lucas Tomlinson was with the Defense Secretary today as U.S. allies react to comments and consider how much more support they should provide. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PETE HEGSETH, DEFENSE SECRETARY: Returning to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective. LUCAS TOMLINSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says any deal to end the war must involve the deployment of European soldiers, with the following caveat. HEGSETH: They should be deployed as part of a non NATO mission, and they should not be covered under Article 5. TOMLINSON (voice over): Article 5 of the NATO charter says an attack on one member triggers a military response from the alliance, a cornerstone of American foreign policy. So, any foreign troops who deployed to Ukraine, even those in the alliance would not have NATO protection if attacked. Today at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Hegseth had a previously unscheduled meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart, and later ended any hopes for Ukraine to join the alliance face to face. HEGSETH: The United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement. TOMLINSON (voice over): With Lithuania's top diplomat took to X to voice his displeasure. If this deal produces a piece of paper guaranteeing peace for our time, we should call it Munich 2. A reference to the 1938 Munich Agreement, which appeased Hitler's expansion of Nazi Germany into Czechoslovakia, ultimately leading to the start of World War II. Hegseth also had a blunt message for NATO allies, following President Trump's call for the alliance to spend five percent of their gross domestic product on defense, the U.S. currently spends 3.4 percent. HEGSETH: The United States will no longer tolerate an imbalanced relationship which encourages dependency. TOMLINSON (voice over): A message reinforced to German and British counterparts today. JOHN HEALEY, BRITISH DEFENSE MINISTER: We also hear your concerns on stepping up for Ukraine, we are and we will. On stepping up for European security, we are and we will. (END VIDEOTAPE) TOMLINSON (on camera): Defense Secretary Hegseth returns to NATO headquarters tomorrow, where he will likely deliver more blunt messages to NATO allies. He will also take questions from the press, Bret. BAIER: Lucas Tomlinson traveling with the defense secretary in Brussels. Lucas, thank you. Back here at home, a House Oversight Subcommittee on the Department of Government Efficiency held its first hearing today. What started with statements committing to bipartisan work, soon turned into criticism over actions DOGE has already taken. Senior National Correspondent Aishah Hasnie gives us a recap of the hearing from Capitol Hill. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) AISHAH HASNIE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The first DOGE hearing on Capitol Hill was billed as a war on waste, but devolved into a partisan battle over Elon Musk as Democrat Congressman Robert Garcia drew an explicit comparison, recalling when the committee chair herself hit Hunter Biden below the belt. REP. ROBERT GARCIA (D-CA): In the last Congress, Chairwoman Greene literally showed (EXPLETIVE DELETED) pick in our oversight congressional hearing, so I thought I'd bring one as well. HASNIE (voice over): Democrats spent two hours questioning why the DOGE leader wasn't at the hearing. REP. JASMINE CROCKETT (D-TX): This is the first time we're having a DOGE subcommittee hearing, and that guy is not here. HASNIE (voice over): Why DOGE isn't looking into Musk's contracts? REP. GREG CASAR (D-TX): Do you know how much money a day Mr. Musk will receive from the federal government for his contracts? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. CASAR: The answer is $8 million a day. HASNIE (voice over): And whether Musk has the legal authority to dig into federal departments in the first place. REP. MELANIE STANSBURY (D-NM): Why is a private citizen being given access to this system? HASNIE (voice over): Republicans say Democrats just don't want to face the waste they're responsible for. REP. TIM BURCHETT (R-TN): The gravy train for a lot of these folks, it's been on biscuit wheels. It's about to run off the dadgum tracks. HASNIE (voice over): And that DOGE is delivering on President Trump's campaign promise to find and cut waste. REP. BRANDON GILL (R-TX): We are uncovering what could be the biggest money laundering scandal in American history. And the other side of the aisle could care less. HASNIE (voice over): Democrats now demanding the leader of DOGE come in and testify on Capitol Hill. Republicans say he's more than welcome. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Elon has an open invitation to come in front of our committee anytime he wants. HASNIE (voice over): But Fox is told that is unlikely to happen anytime soon. REP. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE (R-GA): I think Democrats want Elon Musk in front of the committee so they can berate him, attack him and harass him. (END VIDEOTAPE) HASNIE (on camera): And Bret, Fox is told that the DOGE subcommittee's next hearing will focus on USAID. In the meantime, DOGE finally has its website up and running. It has content and links on it, lots of different graphics for users to peruse through, as the White House promises transparency with this new agency, Bret. BAIER: Aishah Hasnie live on the Hill. Aishah, thanks. Up next, we examine the latest inflation report that shows consumer prices rose more than expected last month. First, Beyond our Borders tonight, at least 20 people were injured in a fire at a clothing factory in Rio de Janeiro. About 90 firefighters helped get that fire under control and rescued the workers trapped inside. One worker said the fire started on the ground floor while they were asleep. More than 10 million Hindus took a dip in the holy waters of northern India. Authorities deployed police officers and put air ambulances on standby for that festival. It is considered the world's largest gathering of humanity. And this is a live look at Budapest, courtesy of Earth Cam. One of the big stories there tonight, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban meets with Germany's far right candidate for Chancellor. Mainstream German leaders have been working to contain the alternative for Germany party. The country is set to vote in an earlier, early election this year -- later this month, after the chancellor Olaf Scholz's governing coalition collapsed in November. Just some of the other stories Beyond our Borders tonight, we'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Reagan tonight, just in the past few minutes, a federal judge has restored President Trump's deferred resignation program. This clears the way for the Trump administration to downsize the federal workforce through buyouts offered to some employees. White House says at least 65,000 employees accepted the offer so far, a big win in Court tonight for the Trump administration. President Trump is criticizing legal challenges to his agenda, saying the courts are holding up his efforts to cut spending. Chief Washington correspondent Mike Emanuel looks at what's next for some of the president's top priorities. Good evening, Mike. MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Well, Bret, good evening to you. The D.C. judges' order to federal health agencies to restore web sites containing gender identity information is just the latest legal challenge by judges taking aim at early Trump administration action. Judges have also tried to block, or at least slow down the federal grant and program funding freeze, Treasury department payment system accessed by DOGE, the federal employee buyout plan, and birthright citizenship. Today, Attorney General Pam Bondi vented frustration with unelected judges. And while federal judges have lifetime appointments, Bondi says the administration can appeal their rulings. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PAM BONDI, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES: If they don't rule in our favor, we will go to the United States Supreme Court and get clarification and get a ruling, because we have outrageous, overzealous, unconstitutional judges trying to control federal spending. EMANUEL (voice over): President Trump says he will abide by the courts if they rule against his actions, but notes he campaigned on these policies. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're talking about tens of billions of dollars that we've already found. And now, a judge is an activist judge. Wants to try and stop us from doing this. Why? And why would they want to do that? EMANUEL (voice over): Liberal justice, Sonia Sotomayor, weighed in on this issue of separation of powers in remarks last night, but did not mention the president by name. SONIA SOTOMAYOR, ASSOCIATE JUSTICE, SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have to, in our opinions, make it clear to the society, to the presidents, to the Congress, to the people, that we are doing things based on law and the Constitution, as we are interpreting it fairly. EMANUEL (voice over): Elon Musk, who is leading the administration charge on potentially impeaching judges, Bondi rejected the notion of impeaching judges, but offered a measure of support for Musk. BONDI: And we're going to back up Elon Musk every way we can. That includes lawsuits against these people who are doing that, and we will be successful. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you have excerpts (PH) about judicial impeachments? That's not going to happen now. We're going to -- we're going to look at everything. We're going to follow the law right now. We're going to follow the process. These are federal judges with lifetime appointments, but they will be struck down ultimately by the Supreme Court of the United States. (END VIDEOTAPE) EMANUEL: Former inspectors general, including for the departments of state and defense, are suing to get their jobs back, saying they were illegally fired. Bret? BAIER: OK, Mike. Thank you. An inflation report out today is dimming hopes for further interest rate cuts. Stocks were mixed on that news today. The Dow was -- Dow was down, 225. It was down much more during the day. S&P 500 fell 17. The NASDAQ was up six. Let's take a closer look at that new inflation report and how it impacted markets today. Fox Business correspondent, Grady Trimble is in New York. Good evening, Grady. GRADY TRIMBLE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. Stocks falling today because investors think the higher-than-expected inflation rate means interest rates are going to stay higher for longer. Prices rose a half of a percent from December to January. They climbed three from a year ago. For the highest inflation rate since June. The cost of transportation, shelter, food, and energy are all higher than a year ago. Looking at specific food items, egg prices are up 53 percent. That's largely because of a bird flu outbreak. But other staples, like coffee, pork, and milk, are also up from a year ago. On Truth Social, President Trump calling these numbers, Biden inflation. He says, ""Interest rates should be lowered, something which would go hand in hand with upcoming tariffs. Let's rock and roll, America!"" On Capitol Hill today, Fed Chair Jerome Powell, says the Federal Reserve doesn't, ""Get excited about one or two bad readings, and we'll wait for more economic data to come in tomorrow."" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEROME POWELL, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE: With our policy stance now significantly less restricted than it -- restricted than it had been, and the economy remaining strong, we do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance. (END VIDEO CLIP) TRIMBLE: And some economists say they are not that worried about these numbers either, because they say the government doesn't do a good job accounting for one time price hikes that go into place at the beginning of the year. Bret? BAIER: OK, Grady. Thank you. Up next, Brit Hume and Charles Payne join us to discuss President Trump's economic and foreign policy agenda. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MELANIE STANSBURY (D-NM): What's going on, guys? I thought you were going to tackle inflation and food and energy prices. Have you been too busy trying to actually address the fiscal health of this country? AUSTAN GOOLSBEE, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF CHICAGO: The inflation numbers that we got today, which are concerning, though they are just one month, they are concerning. They are not the result of any policy of the new administration. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Well, it was a Consumer Price Index we got today, and it was hotter than anybody thought, 3.0 overall, 3.3 in the core. And if you look at inflation, under President Biden-Vice President Harris, starts at 1.4 ends at 2.9 in December, and then it takes up to two three overall when you get to January. Let's start there. We'll bring in Fox News chief political analyst Brit Hume and Charles Payne of Fox Business. Charles, how do you interpret this CPI? What it means? Obviously, the markets got jittery today because the concern about interest rates and what that means for that? CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Yes, two things. On the market side, this sort of puts the Fed out of play. There were slim hopes that maybe there be some rate cuts later this year. Wall Street loves free money or a combination by the Federal Reserve. No one is thinking rate hikes just yet. But that being said, there is this issue called sticky inflation. Things that were up huge. Auto insurance up almost 12 percent from a year ago. Airline fees up seven percent -- auto repair. You always wonder why these commercials were broken windows, right? Auto repair, right? Up six percent. That stuff has been climbing month to month beginning, going all the way back to July of last year. There is been sequential, incremental climbs. And it's it -- we haven't been able to douse this. BAIER: Yes. PAYNE: And so, that's going to remain a problem. And then, midday, by the way, I just have to mention this, we had an auction of bonds that didn't go too well. This year, our government has to refinance $3 trillion in bonds, and if there's not a market for it, there's always a market for it, but at a higher price, maybe, and that means yields up, and that could also pressure the market. BAIER: You know, Brit, over the weekend, I asked President Trump about prices and how he's going to tackle them. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: If all goes to plan, when do you think families will be able to feel prices going down? Groceries, energy, or you kind of saying to them, hang on, inflation may get worse until it gets better. TRUMP: No, I think we're going to become a rich -- look, we're not that rich right now. We owe $36 trillion. That's because we let all these nations take advantage of us. Same thing like $200 billion with Canada. We owe $300 -- we have a deficit with Mexico of $350 billion. I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to let that happen. (END VIDEO CLIP) BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: And Brit, he's getting positions tomorrow to institute more reciprocal tariffs, as he's calling them, ahead of India Prime Minister Modi's visit here to Washington. BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes, and I think, you know, all things being equal, Bret, tariffs tend to drive prices up. Anything that adds costs to manufacturers and other producers causes them to raise prices to cover that. So, that is something that has got to concern the administration. I don't think, however, Bret, that this current number on inflation should -- concerning, perhaps, the administration, but it shouldn't be alarming. I don't think the public, I don't think the voting public expected the administration to solve this problem in the first weeks or even months of this administration. If, however, we get down to where we are getting toward the midterm elections and people are still finding prices going up, up, and up, or staying up in all categories, that would be a political problem. It's a political problem that basically slew the previous president's political standing. So it's something to keep an eye on. BAIER: Brit, while I have you about the Russia situation, obviously this negotiation seems to have started in earnest. HUME: Yes. It looks like the president expects this to happen. He's going to try to, I guess, be the broker, the man who helped end the war. I'm sure there are going to be people who are disappointed, particularly in Ukraine, about Pete Hegseth saying that Ukraine -- that NATO membership is not in the cards for Ukraine. And also saying that returning to the pre-2014 borders, which would mean the recapture of the Crimea, is probably not in the cards either. But I don't think either of those things was something that Ukraine could realistically expect as a result of this current conflict. I think if Ukraine is able to claw back from Russia some if not most of the territory that it took in this recent conflict, that that would be something that that country would have to go for and would be considered a satisfactory resolution to this war which has been so bloody for so long. BAIER: Charles, going back to the tariffs question and Modi's arriving, how do you think the fallout from all of those tariffs is going to play out on the economy? CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS: If you look at tariffs, particularly over a longer period of time, two of the most amazing period of times in American history of prosperity, the McKinley era, which was a 36-year run of prosperity, had three components -- evolving technology that American protected, tough immigration policies, and high tariffs. The roaring 20s, 1921 we had the Emergency Tariff Act, in 1922 we had the Fordney-McCumber Tariff Act and those lasted all the way to 1930. They went hand in hand with the roaring 20s. By the way, Smooth-Hawley, when those tariffs when into place, we didn't get inflation. We got the greatest deflation ever. We remember last time President Trump was in office, inflation went down. It did not go up. Yes, prices can go up. It doesn't mean people have to pay them. And if someone wants to sell those goods, beginning with the exporting country, they have to make adjustments. I don't have to buy a beach ball from China even if I am going to the beach. BAIER: Yes, you just want to avoid 1929, right? PAYNE: Yes. Well, that was the federal reserve. We will get into that later. In 1928 the New York Federal Reserve thought the market was too hot, and I blame that on the New York Fed. BAIER: Brit, last thing, do you think there is still this optimism? Obviously Democrats are attacking, saying we're at a constitutional crisis and all this stuff that's happening with DOGE they have a problem with, but do you still feel that there is this optimism in the country? HUME: I think so, certainly on the part of those who voted for President Trump. And look, somebody obviously put some thought into how to carry out this early assault on spending on these agencies, because so far he has been picking issues where the public is not going to be with the Democrats. They are not going to -- the public isn't in favor of wasteful spending at USAID. The public isn't going to be worried about spending cuts at the Department of Education when that agency has spent billions over decades and the test scores in this country are still going down. The public -- on another subject, the public isn't going to be against the crackdown on the border, which was obviously lawlessness on a grand scale tolerated if not encouraged by the previously administration. So I would say in political terms it's so far so good for the Trump administration. BAIER: Brit, Charles, appreciate the time. Thank you. PAYNE: See you. BAIER: Up next, we have new data on the got-aways at the southern border, and it's shocking. Plus, Attorney General Pam Bondi is cracking down on one sanctuary state. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: We have new data tonight from Homeland Security officials showing the daily average of recorded got-aways has dropped significantly in the last several weeks. Encounters are also down after tens of thousands of appointments were canceled for migrants seeking a permit to internet U.S. The Homeland Security Department is also addressing the illegal alien cris beyond the U.S.-Mexico border. Correspondent Bill Melugin takes a look at the latest numbers and the spending fights. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) BILL MELUGIN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: President Trump's strict policies at the southern border appear to be having an immediate impact just weeks into his second term. As illegal crossings plummet to historic lows, so, too, are the number of illegal aliens sneaking into the country without apprehension, a population known as got-aways. A senior Homeland Security official tells FOX since February 1st, the average daily number of recorded got-aways at the southern border is just 132. That is a 93 percent decrease from the all-time highs of the Biden administration in fiscal year 2023, a timeframe that averaged more than 1,800 got-aways every single day. A senior DHS source is reacting to the huge drop off, telling FOX in part, quote, ""We have only just begun. Policy matters."" In the meantime, the department says it is now recouped a full $59 million- dollar payment FEMA made to New York City from migrant hotels, a payment that led to the firings of several individuals involved. A DHS spokesperson says in part, quote, ""Secretary Noem has clawed back the full payment that FEMA deep state activists unilaterally gave to New York City migrant hotels. FEMA was funding the Roosevelt hotel that serves as a Tren de Aragua base of operations and was used to house Laken Riley's killer. There will not be a single penny spent that goes against the interest and safety of the American people."" Today, New York City's comptroller claimed it was actually $80 million FEMA money that was clawed back, and he wants it returned. BRAD LANDER, NEW YORK CITY COMPTROLLER: If we don't get it back, then the city will have to cut $80.5 million somewhere else. (END VIDEO TAPE) MELUGIN (on camera): And late this afternoon, Attorney General Pam Bondi announced she is suing the state of New York, including Governor Kathy Hochul and Attorney General Letitia James. She is accusing them of prioritizing illegal aliens over American citizens, with Bondi adding, quote, ""This stops today."" Bret? BAIER: Bill Melugin in L.A. Bill, thanks. Flu cases are at the highest number in 15 years according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, COVID-19 cases appear to be in decline according to hospital data and CDC modeling projections. A powerful winter storm blanketing the Midwest and the great plains now, at least one person in Missouri was killed in a vehicle crash. That storm is expected to travel northeast, bringing snowy conditions to New England overnight and on Thursday. It comes after the east coast is recovering from its first round of heavy snow and freezing rain, including here in Washington. Tens of thousands were without power. Hundreds of traffic accidents were reported. On the west coast, California bracing for downpours over the next several days, and that could cause flooding in areas destroyed by the wildfires. Up next, the panel on President Trump's foreign policy agenda, Ukraine, Defense Secretary Hegseth's first foreign trip. First, here's what some of our FOX affiliates around the country are covering tonight. FOX 5 in San Diego where a Navy fighter jet has crashed into the bay near Shelter Island while attempting to land. Both pilots were able to safely eject and they were rescued by a fishing vessel before being taken to the hospital. FOX 32 in Chicago where the longest serving legislative leader in U.S. history is convicted on corruption charges. Jurors found former Democratic Illinois House speaker Michael Madigan guilty on 10 counts of conspiracy, bribery, wire fraud, and other counts related to schemes involving the state's largest electric utility. Jurors acquitted Madigan of seven counts and could not reach a decision on six others. And this is a live look at Cleveland from FOX 8. One of the big stories there tonight, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame announces its 2025 nominees. Fourteen performers, including Mariah Carey, Cindy Lauper, Outkast, Oasis, and Billy Idol will be added. That's tonight's live look outside the beltway from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: I think we're on the way to getting peace. I think President Putin wants peace and President Zelenskyy wants peace and I want peace. Ukraine cannot go into NATO. And I'm OK with that. I just want the war, whether they are or they're not. MICHAEL MCFAUL, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO RUSSIA: I'm all for negotiations, but they have to be negotiations that lead to a lasting peace. They can't be capitulation. They can't be appeasement just because you like Vladimir Putin. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Two phone calls with the two leaders, the Russian leader and the Ukrainian leader, both, according to President Trump, want peace and want to sit down very soon. What about that next step? We'll start there with our panel, Guy Benson, political editor at Townhall.com, host of ""The Guy Benson Show"" on FOX News Radio, Josh Kraushaar is a FOX News Radio political analyst, and ""Axios"" political reporter Stef Kight. Guy, it sounded promising. I think there were Ukrainian activists and supporters who listened to the nuance of some of the president's answers and got worried that he is going to give away the store in this negotiation. He's going to meet with Putin separately in Saudi Arabia first, and there's just doubts or questions about how that negotiation is going to go. GUY BENSON, POLITICAL EDITOR, TOWNHALL.COM: Yes, well, we'll see. I think just like any conversation around the Middle East right now has to start with October 7th and what Hamas did. With this conflict, it must be said that Russia started it. It was a war of aggression. It was completely illegitimate, and that's ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 hundreds of thousands of deaths. And we heard some probably difficult truths from the defense secretary today on this front. The balancing act, which is extremely difficult, is how do you extract the United States and both of the parties in this war from an ongoing crisis without seeming to have rewarded Russia for what they did? There have to be some concessions from both sides. It'll be painful to some extent. The big question is we know what Putin is going to probably want. What is Zelenskyy willing to agree to? And will it be good enough for the Ukrainian people? That's something for them to think about, but certainly a tough needle to try to thread for the United States and President Trump. BAIER: Yes. Stef, he mentions Defense Secretary Hegseth. Here's his comments in Brussels. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PETE HEGSETH, DEFENSE SECRETARY: We must start by recognizing that returning to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders is unrealistic objective. The United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement. SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN, (D-MD) SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE: You don't begin a negotiation the way the Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth did, by unilaterally giving up all sorts of leverage and undercutting the Ukrainian people. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: but the Trump people say, listen, we were never for Ukraine going into NATO, and maybe there is a security agreement that deals with Europe. If you look at the map, Russia really wants that port, that Black Sea port down there by Crimea, and access to the Black Sea. STEF KIGHT, POLITICAL REPORTER," """"AXIOS"""": Yes. I mean", it's clear that the Trump administration is taking a very radically different approach than the Biden administration in dealing with this. Trump going directly to Putin, having a phone call, saying he is willing to talk to him. Trump having a phone call with Putin before Zelenskyy, of course, starting to hash out that plan before going to Ukraine. And yes, there are people who are concerned that the Trump administration is already giving away some of Ukraine's key points of leverage, saying that NATO is off the table, saying that, getting back to the 2014 borders of Ukraine is off the table and, again, going to Russia first, there are concerns that Ukraine ends up being forced into a position to accept more than they ordinarily would have been able to. But it's also very clear that Trump wants this war to end. He is moving quickly and he is going to do whatever he can to kind of get to a resolution. But this is still early and a lot can change in the next few weeks. BAIER: Josh? JOSH KRAUSHAAR, FOX NEWS RADIO POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes. I think, Bret from your interview with Donald Trump when he said Ukraine could be, some of it could be Russian, some of it could be Ukrainian. That was the first red flag that raised the concern of Zelenskyy and a lot of the allies of Ukraine. Donald Trump is known for making -- being the dealmaker in chief. He is liking to make these deals. He has already discussed a lot vis-a-vis the Middle East. I think what is concerning, though, is that, as Stef said, he is giving up a lot of leverage on the front end. I think there is -- I think Trump is right that there is the pathway for a deal to be made. I think Russia's troops are exhausted. Ukraine probably would also like to have the war end with certain military and security guarantees. The question is, are you meeting with Putin before Zelenskyy, making concessions on the front end? That is what is a little concerning, and it will be very fascinating to see how the deal making goes on. BAIER: The security part of it was key for Zelenskyy. When I went for the anniversary of the war on the front lines in Ukraine, he emphasized it a number of times. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Could you be sure of any agreement. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): I believe only in legal agreements, a significant one, powerful one. I believe that for Ukraine being part of NATO is important, important for surviving. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: It was cold that day. He talked a lot in English, but when he really wanted to make a point, he talked in his native language. BENSON: And to simplify it -- grotesquely, probably -- but if there can be a security agreement that is satisfactory to the Ukrainian leadership, that would be the carrot. The question to this conversation is, what would the stick look like for Russia? And we don't know that yet. BAIER: Yes. All right, in the meantime, there is a lot of pushback on this effort, domestically to go after waste, fraud, and abuse. What about this effort by Democrats, Stef, and is it working? Is it the constitutional crisis thing sticking? KIGHT: I don't know that the constitutional crisis is sticking just yet. I think there are still question about how these cuts actually pan out, whether they actually stick, whether Congress takes some of these cuts that DOGE is proposing and actually makes them permanent. I've heard from congressional leaders, both John Thune and Mike Johnson who have said that they are looking at these cuts as kind of a blueprint for where Congress can make more long-term cuts that would have better legal standing. When it comes to a constitutional crisis," """"crisis"""" is kind of a loaded term right now", but there are certainly big constitutional questions being asked right now about how much authority the executive branch has when it comes to collapsing federal agencies and making spending cuts, especially when Congress is really the arm that is tasked with deciding how money is spent. BAIER: Yes. But to listen to Elon Musk talk about it yesterday was really quite something, about the blank checks going out the door that don't have lists where they are going, about the people getting Social Security checks that are 155 or 160. These are Democrats, though, in this hearing today really going after them. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Donald Trump and Elon Musk are recklessly and illegally dismantling the federal government. REP. GREG CASAR, (D-TX) HOUSE DOGE SUBCOMMITTEE: The so-called Department of Government Efficiency that really is the department of government efficiency for Elon Musk, not for you. REP. STEPHEN LYNCH, (D-MA) HOUSE DOGE SUBCOMMITTEE: We are going after waste, fraud, and abuse. Let's start with abuse, abuse of power. REP. WILLIAM TIMMONS, (R-SC) HOUSE DOGE SUBCOMMITTEE: I would just ask my colleague across the aisle to get out of the way if you don't want to help. If you don't want to help right the fiscal ship in this country, get out of the way. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: I get the battles, the process, but at home, I don't know, politically it seems like most people are like go for it, figure it out. KRAUSHAAR: There's the legal aspect, but there's also the political aspect. And on the political front, Donald Trump and Elon Musk are winning. The federal government is not particularly popular. It may be in Washington but not throughout most of the rest of the country. And you have heard Republicans and Democrats for many, many years talk about getting rid of waste, fraud, and abuse. And Bret, I was shocked at the Democrat, the pushback not just at the hearings, but in front of these agencies, singing 1930s union songs, putting Elizabeth Warren, Ilhan Omar as their lead spokespeople. It is not a sign that Democrats have learned their lesson from the election. BAIER: Yes, I mean, there was all this talk about Democrats trying to find their political message and what they're going to grab onto. I'm not sure this is it. BENSON: They have landed on going to the mat for federal bureaucrats and illegal immigrants. That's a really interesting political choice. And if I were Trump and his team, I would lobby the opposition to have these rallies every day. Have a bunch of government union people out there singing their deranged songs with their pre-printed-out placards with Elizabeth Warren screaming on the microphone. I think that is a very unsympathetic picture that is being broadcast to the American people. And you might see the president's numbers go up, quite frankly, as a result of it. They are demanding, this cabal, basically, a continuation of a status quo that works for them that is unacceptable to most Americans. And they are insisting that is untouchable, that they are untouchable. And that they enjoy this in perpetuity employment guarantee that no one in the private sector would ever dream of. And as I said, it's very unsympathetic and, I think, ultimately helpful to team Trump. KIGHT: I would add you both are right that there is a lot of agreement in the country that the federal government needs to be trimmed down and all that. But I do think we need to watch how these cuts actually go into effect, because there are federal workers in states across the country. And if these start impacting key communities, if these start impacting red districts, red states when it actually comes down to the impact of these cuts, that where we could start seeing the conversation change, and that's one thing -- BAIER: And just quick, putting up the executive orders through February 12th, just a comparison, the first Trump administration,12, Biden administration 30. We are at 64. We have many more to go, something tells me. Josh? KRAUSHAAR: Yes, and he is focused on the issues in the campaign that were 80-20 issues, the ones that were most effective for the Republican candidates and for Trump. BAIER: Like plastic straws. OK. BENSON: It's a winner. BAIER: All right, see you guys, thanks. And finally tonight, a special day. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We just realized that I helped a kid, or I made a difference in a kid's life from their point of view. It's like, OK, then I'm here for a reason. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Students in South Pasadena, California, helping a third grade teacher restore a cherished collection. Karen Cabot kept thousands of cards students made for her over the span of 30 years, but all of them were lost when her home was destroyed in recent wildfires. Students past and present are now sending her videos and new cards by the hundreds, even students she taught decades ago, and contributing to new collection. Great story. Tomorrow on SPECIAL REPORT, the Senate considers President Trump's pick for Education Secretary. We will cover it all fair, balanced," and unafraid. Here's Laura.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""BREAKING TONIGHT"", President Trump has a message for his counterparts in Russia and Ukraine. You guys need to get together. The president is clarifying some of his opinions about the nearly three- year long conflict, and denying he will be meeting Vladimir Putin in Moscow in early May. Also tonight, President Trump and Maine's Democratic governor, trading barbs over transgender participation in sports. Plus, another legal win for DOGE tonight. Senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy starts us off live from the North Lawn. Good evening, Peter. PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Sounds like a busy day here at the White House, Bret. And President Trump is telling us the United States and Ukraine are getting closer to a deal where the United States would provide security assistance in exchange for access to rare earth minerals. That, President Trump says is how the United States would get hundreds of millions of dollars spent in Ukraine back. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: President Putin and President Zelenskyy are going to have to get together. DOOCY (voice over): The president continued pressuring Ukraine's Zelenskyy. TRUMP: They don't have any cards, but they play it tough. DOOCY (voice over): But insists, he's not sympathetic to Russia, and disputes a report that he'd visit Moscow in May. And the president acknowledged earlier today that Putin was the aggressor. TRUMP (via telephone): I'm not trying to make Putin like, nicer or better. I'm just telling you the fact that war should have never happened. Putin would have never gone in. DOOCY (voice over): DOGE won in federal court today, as a judge rules thousands of USAID workers can be removed from their jobs. TRUMP: We have nothing to hide. DOOCY (voice over): And President Trump handed a list of alleged false Social Security payments directly to the attorney general, Pam Bondi. TRUMP: Here Pam, you better take a look at this. That's much better for you than for me. DOOCY (voice over): Before leaving the White House, the attorney general confirmed she's also reviewing a possible future release of the late Jeffrey Epstein's client list. PAM BONDI, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES: It's sitting on my desk right now to review. That's been a directive by President Trump. I'm reviewing that. DOOCY (voice over): An extraordinary moment at today's governor's luncheon as President Trump called out one of his guests for violating his executive order, banning biological men from women's sports. Democratic governor, Janet Mills. TRUMP: Is the Maine here? The governor of Maine? GOV. JANET MILLS (D-ME): Yes, I'm here. TRUMP: Are you not going to comply with it? MILLS: I'm complying with state and federal laws. DOOCY (voice over): Two hours later, the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights accused Maine of a Title IX violation. In a release, the education department writes, ""State laws do not override federal antidiscrimination laws."" MILLS: We'll see you in court. TRUMP: Every state -- good. I'll see you in court. And enjoy your life after, Governor, because I don't think you'll be in elected politics. (END VIDEOTAPE) DOOCY (on camera): This bubbled up onto the White House's radar this week when a Maine state representative accused the winner of the women's or rather, of the girls' high school pole vaulting championship of being a transgender man who identifies as a girl, depending on what the education department fines, as much as $250 million in federal funds for Maine hang in the balance. Bret. BAIER: Peter Doocy, live on the North Lawn. Peter, thanks. President Trump's pick to run the FBI is on the job tonight. Kash Patel was sworn in a short time ago, already promising big changes at the Bureau. Correspondent David Spunt is at the justice department tonight. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Kash Patel, sworn in by Attorney General Pam Bondi, as the ninth director of the FBI. He promises change to a bureau that's been no stranger to controversy since its founding in 1908. TRUMP: One of the reasons I loved Kash and wanted to put him in is because of the respect the agents had for him. SPUNT (voice over): Director Patel, wants to send more employees out of Washington into field offices across the country. He also vows more transparency. KASH PATEL, FORMER DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE CHIEF OF STAFF UNDER TRUMP: There will be accountability within the FBI and outside of the FBI. And we will do it through rigorous constitutional oversight starting this weekend. SPUNT (voice over): In a social media statement, Patel says, ""We will rebuild an FBI the American people can be proud of. And to those who seek to harm Americans, consider this your warning. We will hunt you down in every corner of this planet."" His past controversial statements like closing down the FBI headquarters on day one and opening it up as a museum of the, ""Deep State"" has critics unnerved. A source close to Patel says that won't happen. Before his confirmation vote, Democratic senators stood outside the FBI headquarters with a sign containing. ""Block Patel"" SEN. SHELDON WHITEHOUSE (D-RI): Kash Patel, mark my words, will cause evil in this building behind us, and Republicans, who vote for him will rue that day. SPUNT (voice over): In a statement obtained by Fox News, the FBI Agents Association, a group of almost 14,000 active FBI special agents, congratulated Patel, adding it, ""Stands ready to serve as a valuable resource, ensuring that special agents can continue safeguarding the American people from emerging threats while upholding the Constitution."" (END VIDEOTAPE) SPUNT (on camera): In his speech today, after being sworn in, he said to the media critics, bring it on, but attack him, and leave the good men and women of the FBI out of it. Bret. BAIER: David Spunt at the justice department. David, thanks. The justice department has sent a written complaint about a federal judge - - to the chief judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The letter from Attorney General Pam Bondi's chief of staff was obtained by Fox News. It concerns what the justice department calls misconduct on the part of District Judge Ana Reyes, during a case brought by LGBTQ groups, challenging the Trump administration's executive orders, barring transgender individuals from serving in the military. It says the judge compromised the dignity of the proceedings and demonstrated potential bias, raising serious concerns about her ability to preside impartially. The budget battle rages on, on Capitol Hill. The focus now turns to the House, as Republicans hope to fund President Trump's agenda. Senate Republicans advanced their budget blueprint early this morning in an effort to prep President Trump's so-called big, beautiful bill of tax and spend cuts. Democrats used the session to try to counter the GOP's policies. A sleep deprived. Senior congressional correspondent, Chad Pergram, reports on the Senate's overnight session. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The Senate passed its budget plan early this morning. But now, the House is under pressure to approve its measure, endorsed by President Trump and emphasizing tax cuts. REP. RUSSELL FRY (R-SC): If we don't act, if we don't do our job, that everyone's taxes are going up. And so that is absolutely going to be catastrophic to the American people. PERGRAM (voice over): One Republican, conceding a possible way to reduce substantial spending is by trimming Medicare and Medicaid. REP. ERIC BURLISON (R-MO): If we cut all of that, we still won't balance the budget. We have a deficit of $2 trillion. We -- so, we have got to touch our mandatory spending. PERGRAM (voice over): While you were sleeping, Democrats hope their overnight opposition to President Trump wasn't a legislative lullaby. In an all-night Senate session, Democrats forced votes on every subject under the moon. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The right to IVF -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Deficits and debt -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Our public lands -- SEN. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): Deadly and devastating wildfires -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Cost of housing -- SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN): Tax cuts. SEN. PATTY MURRAY (D-WA): FAA, childcare, and more. PERGRAM (voice over): However, Republicans do a shut eye, shut out, rejecting every Democratic proposal. Democrats tried to trip up Republicans with votes on tax cuts, even compelling them to weigh in on supporting Ukraine. SEN. ROGER WICKER (R-MS): There is a place to talk about Ukraine. It's not this budget. PERGRAM (voice over): But it was lights-out for the Democrats, as Republicans passed their framework just before dawn. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: On this vote, the yeas are 52, the nays are 48. PERGRAM (voice over): Democrats claim they shined a spotlight on GOP vulnerabilities. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): One amendment at a time, Democrats exposed Republicans' true colors. (END VIDEOTAPE) PERGRAM (on camera): Passing anything in the narrowly divided house is hard. The GOP needs the budget in place to bypass a Senate filibuster, otherwise the bill is stuck. Bret. BAIER: OK, Chad. Get some sleep. Thanks. PERGRAM: I will. BAIER: Economic reports on business activity and consumer sentiment sent stocks tumbling. The Dow falling 749. Its worst day of the year, so far. The S&P was down 104. The NASDAQ lost 438. And there you see for the week, the Dow and the NASDAQ were off 2-1/2 percentage points. The S&P 500 fell one and two-thirds.

AMERICAN CROWD: Free, free, Luigi! MCADAMS (voice over): The hearing only lasted 10 minutes, as the defense and prosecution gave an update on the evidence in this case, including 800 gigabytes of digital evidence and DNA testing. KAREN FRIEDMAN AGNIFILO, ATTORNEY TO LUIGI MANGIONE: He is being publicly treated as guilty, and as -- having the presumption of guilt, as opposed to the presumption of innocence, which is what he is entitled to. MCADAMS (voice over): Police say, Mangione, shot and killed United Healthcare CEO, Brian Thompson. Thompson was a husband and a dad of two. Gunned down in midtown Manhattan. MCADAMS: If this was your dad, and he was murdered because of his job, wouldn't you want the person who killed him to be put behind bars? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, I would -- I personally would have -- well, if Brian Thompson -- if I'll be honest, if Brian Thompson was my dad, I would have, honestly wouldn't care about his funeral. MCADAMS (voice over): As for a motive, police believe Mangione was angry with the health care industry. The 26-year-old facing a long list of charges, including first-degree murder and terrorism. (END VIDEOTAPE) MCADAMS (on camera): So, tonight, Mangione remains in custody here in New York City. He's actually in the same lockup as P. Diddy over in Brooklyn. He'll be back in Court next month or sometime before that, depending on an indictment for his federal case. And Bret, in that case, it could face, and he could face the death penalty. So, we'll keep an eye on it. BAIER: OK. Alexis, thank you. Up next, we take you on an exclusive ride with a border patrol marine unit, looking for smugglers near South Florida. First, ""BEYOND OUR BORDERS"" tonight. Doctors treating Pope Francis say his condition is not life threatening, but he is not out of danger yet. The 88-year-old pontiff is marking his first week in a hospital with pneumonia on top of chronic bronchitis. And this is a live look at Rio de Janeiro. One of the big stories there tonight. Lady Gaga confirms she will perform a free concert on Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana beach, May 3rd. The singer says she has been dying to perform there after canceling in 2017, because of medical reasons. Just some of the other stories ""BEYOND OUR BORDERS"" tonight. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Breaking just a few minutes ago from the Supreme Court, an anticipated order, the Supreme Court acting just moments ago on President Trump's efforts to fire a federal employee. Basically, this is a watchdog agency head, we've been telling you about this bubbling up. Let's bring in Fox News Chief Legal Correspondent anchor of ""FOX NEWS SUNDAY,"" Shannon Bream. Good evening, Shannon. This guy wanted to stay in the job. He was fighting it. What happened tonight? SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: He did. So, the Trump team wanted to fire him. He went to court. He won at the lower court and the appellate court. So the Trump team took this to the Supreme Court, saying he's an executive. He is the executive. He should have the power to fire people within this branch, lift this lower court order that keeps us from firing him. Well, tonight, what the court said was the chief just could have decided alone, but the chief shared it with the rest of the court, and they voted to hold this in abeyance until February 26. Now, that's when the temporary restraining order that keeps this man, Hampton Dellinger, in his job, will expire. So, you did hear from some of the justices, Justices Sotomayor and Jackson would have denied this application altogether, but you've got a dissent from justices Gorsuch and Alito as well about this thing being, ""held in abeyance."" What it means, though, bottom line, Hampton Dellinger stays in the job until at least February 26th, lower court then kicks in, and we'll see what happens from there, Bret. BAIER: You know, the Trump administration has had some wins on DOGE on firings. These are lower court judges. You wonder how many you're going to bubble up all the way to the Supreme Court. BREAM: Yes, this is the first one to get there, and it's sort of a draw, and we'll have to see what happens from here. But the Supreme Court not getting actively involved in this particular dispute just yet. BAIER: OK. Shannon Bream, as always, thank you. BREAM: Thanks, Bret. BAIER: President Trump is reassigning the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, the DHS spokesperson confirming to Fox that Caleb Vitello is no longer an administrator, but will oversee all field and enforcement operations. The Wall Street Journal reporting the administration is not happy with the pace of deportations and arrests of illegal immigrants. President Trump's border crackdown is forcing smugglers to find different methods of bringing drugs and people into the U.S. Tonight, Correspondent Danamarie McNicholl takes us on an exclusive ride with a border patrol marine unit in South Florida. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's a dramatically different threat environment compared to our Southwest border and our Northern Border. DANAMARIE MCNICHOLL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Conditions are unpredictable and dangerous for Customs and Border Protection, Air and Marine agents trying to stop the constant flow of illegal migrants and narcotics from reaching U.S. shores. With the crackdown at the southern land border, traffickers are using the Bahamas as a launching point for their operation, only 50 miles from the Florida coast. ALAN REGALADO, CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION: Most of the time, these individuals are carrying weapons, and they will do anything to avoid apprehension. MCNICHOLL (voice over): This stop turned out to be a routine customs check, but agents say they are regularly faced with smugglers growing bolder. MCNICHOLL: Earlier this month, a boat didn't stop for CBP, agents had to chase after human smugglers disable their engine with a shotgun. 20 illegal migrants were found on that boat. MCNICHOLL (voice over): Hours after our ride along patrol, CBP agents intercepted another boat carrying 13 illegal migrants. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They're going to try different times a day, different days of the week to try to look for those gaps. MCNICHOLL (voice over): A reason why border security on the water is a whole of government approach, local and state and federal agencies exchange resources and Intel daily. The U.S. Coast Guard, which has recently increased its resources in the region, is responsible for repatriation. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We can't be every place it wants. So, it's kind of a needle in the haystack situation. MCNICHOLL (voice over): But Florida isn't the only hot spot. On the West Coast, boats carrying illegal migrants have been detected as far north as the Bay Area, hundreds of miles from the Mexican border. In Miami, Danamarie McNicholl, Fox News.

We have new information tonight about the bodies released yesterday, and some of it is very disturbing. National Correspondent Jeff Paul reports tonight from London. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEFF PAUL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Hours after their bodies were released by Hamas in black wooden boxes, the family of 9-month- old Kfir Bibas and his 4-year-old brother Ariel, were told the two young boys had been killed on purpose by their kidnappers. OFRI BIBAS LEVY, AUNT (through translator): We waited for certainty, but it brings no comfort, only profound grief, my sweet nephews were taken alive from their home and murdered by a cruel terrorist organization while in captivity. They didn't deserve such a fate. PAUL (voice over): Hamas claims without evidence the young boys died in an Israeli air strike, but the IDF says forensic findings and intelligence show otherwise. REAR ADM. DANIEL HAGARI, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES SPOKESPERSON: Ariel and Kfir Bibas were murdered by terrorists in cold blood. The terrorists did not shoot the two young boys. They killed them with their bare hands. PAUL (voice over): Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowing not to rest until whoever is responsible is brought to justice. BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: Who kidnaps a little boy and a baby and murders them? Monsters, that's who. These Hamas monsters also cynically refused to bring back the boy's mother, Shiri, and sent the body of a Gazan woman instead, in brazen violation of the agreement. PAUL (voice over): Hamas pointing to a possible mix up of bodies, saying Shiri's remains were found in an area Israel had bombed where others were present. Adding to the tension, an alleged terrorist attack in central Israel last night, investigators say multiple explosions went off in three parked busses with undetonated bombs found in two others. Authorities say it is a miracle no one was hurt. (END VIDEOTAPE) PAUL (on camera): Now, all of this happening as a very fragile cease fire deal continues to hold. In fact, Hamas putting out a statement earlier today saying they have no reason to break that agreement, and we are expecting the release of as many as six living hostages starting tomorrow, Bret. BAIER: Jeff Paul live in London. Jeff, thanks. Fox News has learned a Houthi surface to air missile was fired at a U.S. F- 16 fighter jet off the coast of Yemen two days ago, it missed. So did another missile targeting a U.S. Reaper drone flying over Houthi controlled area on the same day. This represents a significant escalation in the ongoing military interactions between the Iranian backed group and the American military. Up next, the search for waste, fraud and abuse in government funding now involves a former Democratic gubernatorial candidate, we'll bring you there. And later, tracking down the billions of dollars spent on the so called train to nowhere. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Tonight, the search for waste in government spending is centered on a nonprofit group linked to former Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams. Correspondent Steve Harrigan looks at the money trail this evening from Atlanta. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LEE ZELDIN, EPA ADMINISTRATOR: It was here's $20 billion and it was going to their friends on the left. STEVE HARRIGAN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): A battle is underway by the new head of the EPA to take back more than $20 billion awarded for green energy programs in the final days of the Biden administration. Lee Zeldin claims the money was basically a slush fund to reward left wing political groups, including one where Georgia Democrat and two time failed candidate for governor, Stacey Abrams worked as senior counsel. ZELDIN: If you care about clean air, land and water, if you think there's some community that's been left behind, then why are you spending the dollar actually remediating that issue instead of paying off your friend? HARRIGAN (voice over): The grants were part of the Biden administration's Greenhouse Gas Reduction Program. The money was given to eight different groups, including $2 billion to power forward communities, a coalition of housing, climate and community groups that was started in 2023 and includes Habitat for Humanity and the United Way. The timing of the grants has come under scrutiny just one month after Abrams wrote an op-ed supporting Biden's re-election bid, Democrats dismissed charges of fraud and claim Republicans are just trying to gut funding for environmental protection. SEN. ED MARKEY (D-MA): We have a responsibility to preserve God's great creation, to enhance it and pass it on to future generations. And right now, Elon Musk wants to turn EPA into every polluter's ally. (END VIDEO TAPE) HARRIGAN: No response from Abrams. Freezing the money could lead to a legal challenge. Bret? BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Steve, thank you. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is replacing the city fire chief. The dismissal of Kristin Crowley comes in the aftermath of historic wildfires last month.

A project many consider a waste of billions of dollars is now under the scrutiny of the Trump administration. National Correspondent William La Jeunesse tells us about the uncertain fate of California's high-speed rail effort. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) SEAN DUFFY, TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY: If you want to go protest somewhere, if you want to shout at someone, go to the governor's mansion. Go talk to Democrats in the legislature who have brought us this crappy project. WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: That's Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy responding to hecklers after ordering an audit of California's controversial train to nowhere. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: One step closer to high-speed rail in California. LA JEUNESSE: First approved by voters in 2008, the project is more than a decade behind schedule, and roughly $100 billion short of what's needed to complete the promised L.A. to San Francisco route. SHANNON GROVE, (R) CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE: This is a failed project. It is a complete waste of money for California taxpayers. LA JEUNESSE: California Republican lawmakers joined Duffy at L.A.'s Union Station where they were met by tomato throwing protesters. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Democracy is almost dead. LA JEUNESSE: They favor completing the project with federal support. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is something that will help people for generations, will help take vehicles off the road and help people have more options to get around California. LA JEUNESSE: But 17 years and $16 billion later, the project has yet to lay a single foot of rail. So far federal taxpayers spent almost $3 billion on the project with another $4 billion promised by President Biden. DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: It is the worst managed project I think I have ever seen, and I have seen some of the worst. LA JEUNESSE: The audit could give President Trump authority to claw that money back. DUFFY: We can't just say we're going to give money and then not hold states accountable to how they spend that money. (END VIDEO TAPE) LA JEUNESSE (on camera): Governor Gavin Newsom wants to finish the current central valley leg, but without federal help, that's unlikely, effectively killing the project. Many say any money, federal or state, would be better spent on wildfire prevention or water storage. Bret? BAIER: William, thank you. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: We're going to see what the House comes up with. They are working very hard. They think they are going to get there on one bill, and then the Senate would be able to vote on the one big, beautiful bill, that would include taxes and tax cuts. I would think it's very hard for even Democrats to vote against that. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: President Trump with Brian Kilmeade on the radio today. In tonight's ""Common Ground"", the budget battle brewing on Capitol Hill, plus, an effort to get Congressional Gold Medals for the members of the 1908 U.S. Olympic hockey team that took down the Soviets. Joining us now, Republican Congressman Pete Stauber of Minnesota and Democratic Congressman Mike Quigley of Illinois, dawning the hockey gear. I want to talk hockey in just a second, gentlemen. But I want to get your sense about where this negotiation is on the budget. Congressman Stauber, first to you. Obviously, your Senate colleagues are doing it differently. Where do you think things stand? REP. PETE STAUBER, (R-MN): Well, Bret, this is a good question, timely question. We're working on a budget resolution that we can get across the finish line in the House, and then send it over to the Senate, and then reconciliation after that. But there is going to be a lot of talk. I trust my colleagues who are with Speaker Johnson and President Trump and the Senate leaders working together on behalf of the American people and putting a budget forward that really, we spend our taxpayers' money wisely. And that's really what we're looking forward to doing in a rather quick fashion. We have a quick timeframe. BAIER: Congressman Quigley, you know, you have worked across the aisle with Congressman Stauber, others. There is this exchange program. You went to each other's districts. Can you foresee Democrats getting around some aspects of this budget is where they could vote for it? REP. MIKE QUIGLEY, (D-IL): Look, it really depends on the language we actually finally see. At this point in time, it's all hypothetical. I'll put in context, though. I passed a bill with my Republican colleagues in the last session that had the most co-sponsor, the act for ALS, it was an extraordinarily important bill. So there's ways to find common ground. When I first got there, I won a special election. The best advice I got was from a Republican friend of mine from Illinois who said just remember, The best advice I got was from Republican friend of mine from Illinois who said just remember, the best that comes out of here is through compromise. So, compromise is trying to meet in the middle. It's a lot harder if you start on one extreme or another, and I think that's what everyone has to keep in mind. BAIER: Yes. All right, gentlemen, I want to take you back to the Reagan years and the miracle on ice. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RONALD REAGAN, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: Before the big game with the Soviet team, the coach told the players, you were born for this moment. This is your moment. and I don't think we'll ever forget the picture of those young Americans, not favored to win by a long shot, but, win they did. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Boy, and you think back to that game, the miracle on ice. Congressman Stauber, it's a reflection, last night, the Four Nations, Canada wins in overtime against the U.S. You all want to recognize the 1980 team with Congressional Gold Medals. STAUBER: Well, Bret, 1980 team who won the gold medal beat the Soviets on Friday, February 22nd, 1980. That really resonated with Americans. As you know, during that time we were in crisis. And this team helped build that American spirit. And that's why Mike and I are putting together the Congressional Gold Medal, to honor those young men who made a contribution to our nation that is so -- was so awesome. And still we're talking about it 45 years later. And, you know the clip you had with President Reagan there just to the left of the president's shoulder was Phil Verchota from my hometown of Duluth. There is 12 Minnesotans on that team including Coach Herb Brooks. Mike and I are thrilled to have this going forward. BAIER: Congressman Quigley just that game last night highest rated hockey game in 30 years, 10 million people tuned into that thing. And it did give you goose bumps there, even though the U.S. came out on the short end. QUIGLEY: Look, it's a reflection of what hockey can be if it's in the right context. It's the greatest sport in the world. I want people to remember, though, those especially who weren't around 45 years ago, the college kids on team USA beat a team that was trouncing NHL teams at the time. They went on an exhibition tour and they were beating NHL teams and NHL all-star teams soundly. So this was extraordinary. And, as my friend said, it came at a time of general malaise in the country. The economy was down. It was the height of the cold war. Sports, in a sense, really only matters when it transcends itself. ""Sports Illustrated"" said this was the most important sports moments of the 20th century. Having watched the game, running across the room for a couple hours, remembering that day, I think they were right. BAIER: Yes, it does bring everybody together. And Congressman Stauber, I know you're not wearing the jersey, but we have a picture of you in 1988 after winning the college national championship with President Reagan. So we'll get some hockey memorabilia up on the stage for you. Congratulations working together. I hope everything comes your way, and we'll follow all elements of everything on Capitol Hill. Thanks for coming on. STAUBER: Thank you, Bret. QUIGLEY: Thank you, Bret. BAIER: You can see all of the ""Common Ground"" segments on my podcast ""Common Ground."" Find that and the ""All-Star Panel"" podcast under the Bret Baier podcasts at FOXNewspodcast.com, Spotify, or wherever you download podcasts. You can also see the discussion on the FOX News YouTube page. Up next, the panel on President Trump's latest executive orders, congressional funding, plus, Winners and Losers. First, here's what some of our FOX affiliates around this country are covering tonight. WDRV in Louisville as three people fatally shot outside a driver's license office. Police say a man was pronounced dead at the scene and two women died after being taken to a downtown hospital. No arrests so far in that. KHON in Honolulu as multiple first responder agencies work at the site of an explosion in Kaanapali. It happened last night near the pool area of a condominium. Seven people were injured, three critically. A preliminary investigation suggests a possible malfunction with the grill there. And this is a live look at New York. One of the big stories there tonight from FOX 5, the Yankees drop their ban on beards. The rule was imposed by then owner George Steinbrenner 49 years ago. His son Hal Steinbrenner, who runs the club now, says players will be allowed to have well-groomed beards moving forward. There you go. That's tonight's live look outside the beltway from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: The NCAA has complied immediately, by the way. That's good. But I understand Maine -- is Maine here, the governor of Maine? Are you not going to comply with that? GOV. JANET MILLS, (D) MAINE: I'm complying with state and federal law. TRUMP: We are the federal law. Well, you better do it. You better do it, because you are not going to get any federal funding at all if you don't. And by the way, your population, even though it's somewhat liberal, although I did very well there, your population doesn't want men playing in women's sports. So you better comply, because otherwise you're not getting any -- any federal funding. MILLS: See new court. TRUMP: Every state -",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 we wanted to play that whole exchange there, President Trump and the governor of Maine, about biological men playing in women's sports. A few hours after that, the Department of Education launched a Title IX violation investigation into the Maine Department of Education and Maine school district. So, we'll see where that goes. Another exciting day in Washington. Let's bring in our panel, Charles Hurt," co-host of """"FOX & FRIENDS WEEKEND""""", Leslie Marshall, Democratic strategist, and syndicated radio host Hugh Hewitt. Charlie, what did you make of that exchange? (LAUGHTER) CHARLES HURT, CO-HOST," """"FOX & FRIENDS WEEKEND"""": Trump is back. You know", this is -- it's kind of hard to remind ourselves that this is not the way politics has always been sort of done in the past. This guy is a singular character. And the idea that he would call together this White House ceremony and then call out the governor of Maine for some reprobation over her refusal to go along with his executive order is a pretty extraordinary thing. And I think that it sort of underscores what a strong hand he actually has, because not only is he doing something that I think is very popular, and polling shows that it is, the idea of restoring Title Ix so that it actually means something when it comes to federal funding is a very important thing. But, also, just the raw politics of it and ability to kind of create a clip that ricocheted all over the internet. Everybody is going to see this. And most people are going to be on his side on this. BAIER: Yes, Leslie, you do look at polls, even in some place like Maine, and it is an 80-20 issue. What about the other side of it? LESLIE MARSHALL, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, there are a couple of things here. Charlie, you know I love you very much, and I would laugh, but not at what your laughing at. To me it's laughable that we have the president of the United States acting like a bully, threatening a elected official, a governor from Maine, calling her out. And hey, it's a woman standing out to this guy. Kudos to her. Bret, to your point, this is not an issue where what she is speaking about is popular in Maine or across the board. But then again, it's not the most important issue. It's not even top 10 amongst the people of Maine or the people of the United States. Just look at Maine. What does Maine care about? Maine cares about what they see happening. Maine cares about what their prices are at the gas pump, the prices are at the grocery store. They care about what their prices are when they go to the pharmacy and they have to buy insulin and other things. BAIER: Sure, so why is she going to spend money defending -- why is she going to spend money defending biological men playing in women's sports using Maine's law to go to court to fight the federal government on this? MARSHALL: Well, many people are fighting the federal government on a number of things, and, you know, for her this is her mountain to die on, perhaps. I don't think that will result in her losing re-election. BAIER: But I mean your argument goes the other, is my point. It just goes the other way. Yes, people do care about a lot of other things, Hugh, but when you -- when you are spending money to defend this, and it's a federal law, Title IX, and the president saying he is going to go after it, it seems an easy choice. HUGH HEWITT, SYNDICATED RADIO HOST: She is right, Bret. The story of the Maine pole vaulting competition featuring the girls has a very memorable photo which ricocheted around the Internet yesterday. Governor Mills -- I spend quite a lot of time in Maine, so I'm very familiar with people in Maine. They are not going to be on the governor's side here. They are going to split 80-20. And they are going to be upset if the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights concludes that Maine is in violation of Title IX, which I believe they will. And they are going to lose a lot of money. And by the way, everyone on that stand, the silver medalist, the bronze medalist, and the other runner-up, were not happy either because the crowned champion, the biological boy, now transgender girl, won the boys championship, or did very well last year, came in sixth or something like that, and he beat her by the next closest competitor by six inches, shattering records. So it's not an issue which Democrats want to define their party on. But that exchange today, Donald Trump sees high ground, he is going to stand on it, and it was a big win for the president. BAIER: Speaking of Democrats," here is James Carville on """"HANNITY"""" last night about the way forward. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAMES CARVILLE", DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: I'm telling the Democrats, just sit there, play possum, let them go, let them go, let them go. Poll numbers are declining, the collapse is already underway. Let's see when they put the Medicaid budget, when they put the tax, the $4.5 billion, trillion dollars of tax cuts to wealthy people, just let the ball come to you. We don't need to be aggressive now. We can just sit back. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Charlie, what about that strategy? HURT: What an extraordinary admission, though. The idea that you have all these very important issues. And I agree with you, Leslie, I think there are more important, more pressing issues in people's lives today, like crime, like inflation, like the border. But the idea that you've got probably the smartest strategist on the Democrat side just saying, look, we don't have any answers to participate in any of these debates, so let's just be real quiet and hope they screw up. Man, that's a heck of a strategy coming from probably one of the smartest, most accomplished thinkers on the Democrat side. BAIER: Leslie, quickly, we are seeing in red states concern about some of these firings across the board. And we are seeing some angst bubble up because of what's happening. And, you know, I assume that's what James Carville is talking about. MARSHALL: I, you know, although I do think he is very, very smart, I think there are those of us, myself included, that are pretty bright. And I would disagree with him on this. I don't think that you play possum. I think that you fight, and you fight hard. And when I say that, I don't mean physically. I mean in messaging. And got to get the messaging together in my party. You have to be united. You have to decide what's most important. You have to look at, we a couple years away from midterms and we have the opportunity to flip the House, to flip the Senate, and to have more power. And that messaging has to be fact-checking what the president and this administration is doing and just talking about things that I mentioned where it's hurting Americans, some of these firings and some of these decisions as examples. BAIER: My priority is to get Winners and Losers in. So we are going to do a lightning winner and loser. Hugh, winner first, then loser. HEWITT: My winner for the week is Vice President Vance who has continued a winning streak. He went to Europe last week, did the A.I. speech, owned the Munich Conference, came to D.C. this week, owned the CPAC in a long conversation with Mercedes Schlapp. And he has been online doing a very high end back and forth on X with Niall Ferguson. It's a great week for the vice president. He has a peculiar facility with expression, as another president said about a different individual way back in time. Loser is Olaf Scholz. Another tragic terrorism attack probably in Berlin tonight. Last week the Munich terrorism attack. Scholz is going to get wind out on the elections this weekend in Germany. BAIER: Yes. We will follow it. Charlie, winner and loser? HURT: Winner is Elon Musk and DOGE with his chainsaw. That's pretty spectacular stuff. And I think that this is going to be fight that's going to work very well for them and they can keep it rolling. Loser is Hamas. At a moment where you could at least make the argument that all this bombing hasn't done what it was supposed to do, which is eliminate Hamas, they reveal themselves to be absolute animals in their treatment of these hostages. BAIER: Leslie, winner and loser? MARSHALL: Winner, Michael Sayih, who was a trying to run six Abbott World Majors Majors, and he pass cerebral palsy. Just amazing, and good luck to him. Loser, DOGE. I will take the chainsaw out there because DOGE doesn't note difference between millions and billions. HURT: How dare you? (LAUGHTER) BAIER: All right, have a great weekend, guys. Up next," """"Notable Quotables."""" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: You know that sound. That means it's Friday. It's Friday. Time for """"Notable Quotables.""""

DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: A dictator without elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he's not going to have a country left. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Disgusting betrayal of a country that has bled and fought and died. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): President Trump, unfortunately, lives in this disinformation space. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They killed them with their bare hands. REP.

Mr. Secretary, welcome to you. Thanks for joining us. CHRIS WRIGHT, U.S. ENERGY SECRETARY: Thank you for having me. Thrilled to be here. SMITH: Sadly, we only have a couple minutes here with you. My question to you is this. We went back and looked at the campaign, and President Trump, campaigning President Trump, said he would cut electricity bills in half within the first 12 months of taking office. Is that a goal that is achievable still since you have now taken the reins at the Energy Department? WRIGHT: The president is aggressive. He's angry at what's happened to the American consumers, and he wants to drive down prices, not just electricity, heating, filling your gas tank, buying products. He wants to drive inflation down across the board. And there's actually a lot of low-hanging fruit. We're going to reduce cost to businesses. We're going to encourage the growth and production of energy, of products. So, look, we're going to drive things down as much as we can, as fast as we can. I think you will see significant progress in the next 12 months. JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Mr. Secretary, it's John Roberts here. I wanted to ask you a question about DOGE and staff cuts. Critics say that this is moving too fast without giving appropriate looks at who's being cut. You had a problem there at the National Nuclear Security Administration, where you cut some staff. You had to bring them back. You said that was a mistake. Are these cuts moving too fast? WRIGHT: There's huge inertia in the bureaucracy of Washington. Everyone's talked about changing and reforming government, but it's never happened. Government just keeps growing. My department, the Department of Energy, grew its head count by 20 percent during the last administration. ROBERTS: Yes. WRIGHT: And they were against energy, and their goal was to build obstacles. So we are going to move aggressively. We're going to meet changes. Most of it, I think, is going to go very well. But if you move aggressively and you want to make big change, it's not going to be perfect. And I'm certainly one of those ones. That's been reversed immediately. ROBERTS: Yes. WRIGHT: And I'm pretty excited about our opportunities going forward. SMITH: Mr. Secretary, I have five seconds. Today, the national average for a gallon of gasoline is $3.16. Where will it be by the end of the year? WRIGHT: Oh, I -- I don't know, hopefully lower than that, likely lower than that. (LAUGHTER) SMITH: OK. Well, hopefully, we can get you back on for more time. As soon as you're available, we'd love to have you back. WRIGHT: Sounds great. Thanks for having me. SMITH: All right, thank you. ROBERTS: Thanks, Secretary. Appreciate it.

But first, breaking tonight, President Trump just moments ago in the Oval Office calling the outrage over military plans accidentally being sent to a reporter from The Atlantic a, ""Witch hunt."" The president went on to question if the app Signal was defective. High ranking Trump administration officials are also not backing down, saying that war plans and classified information were never shared. The Atlantic released the entire group chat today, top intelligence officials faced intense questioning on that subject for the second day on Capitol Hill. President Trump also moments ago announcing a 25 percent tariff on all imported cars, calling it the beginning of Liberation Day in America, April 2nd, when the reciprocal tariffs go in place. A busy day for Senior White House Correspondent Jacqui Heinrich, just out from the Oval Office. She joins from the North Lawn. Good evening, Jacqui. JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. That's right, the president just announced a 25 percent tariff on all foreign made cars, in addition to the reciprocal tariffs, of course, coming on April 2nd. He says he did speak with the big three automakers about this, and if they've got their factories in the U.S., they're thrilled. If they don't, they had better get going, otherwise they'll have to pay that tariff. It's pretty simple. He was also asked about this Signal chat that his top intelligence officials were on, accidentally revealing to a reporter. He said he believes that the media focus on this story is a witch hunt meant to distract from the successes of his administration taking out these Houthi terrorists. But he said he will ask his Defense Secretary to review whether the content of those messages should have been classified after his Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, testified today that any information relating to attack plans should be top secret. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I don't know that Signal works. I think Signal could be defective, to be honest with you, and I think that's what we have to because you use Signal, and we use Signal, and everybody uses Signal, but it could be a defective platform, and we're going to have to find that answer. HEINRICH (voice over): With the rest of the private messages out, the White House seizing on The Atlantic downgrading its description of the chat from war plans to attack plans. KAROLINE LEAVITT, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: If this story proves anything, it proves that Democrats and their propagandists in the mainstream media know how to fabricate, orchestrate and disseminate a misinformation campaign quite well. And there's arguably no one in the media who loves manufacturing and pushing hoaxes more than Jeffrey Goldberg. HEINRICH (voice over): Goldberg calling foul. JEFFREY GOLDBERG, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE ATLANTIC: I don't even know what that means. What are they arguing that an attack is different than a war? HEINRICH (voice over): Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth maintains nothing released was classified, a line other officials have relied on. TULSI GABBARD, U.S. DIRECTOR IF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: No classified information was shared. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Declassified the information? MARCO RUBIO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Well, the Pentagon says it was not. HEINRICH (voice over): But it's unclear why exact timing of the attack wasn't classified. HEINRICH: Why are launch times on a mission strike classified? LEAVITT: Again, I would defer you to the Secretary of Defense's statement he put out this morning. There were various reasons he listed things that were not included in that messaging thread that were not classified. HEINRICH (voice over): The Defense Secretary's list did not include launch times or sequencing. REP. JASON CROW (D-CO): ""Information providing indication or advance warning that the U.S. or its allies are preparing for an attack,"" is to be classified as top secret? GABBARD: Yes. CROW: Have the Houthis indicated an ability to shoot down American aircraft? GABBARD: Yes. CROW: They have, in fact, done so, haven't they? GABBARD: Yes. (END VIDEOTAPE) HEINRICH (on camera): The president in the Oval Office was also asked about Senate Republicans formally requesting that the administration approve an inspector general report on this issue. He said that that would not bother him. He would rather know if there is an issue with government use of this app Signal. But he reiterated there was no harm done in this incident, because that attack on the Houthis was carried out successfully, Bret. BAIER: Jacqui Heinrich live on the North Lawn. Jacqui, thank you. U.S. military still pounding Houthi targets in Yemen despite all of this Signal scandal. At the heart of the administration's defense, what constitutes war plans and classified information, as you saw some of the back and forth on Capitol Hill? Chief National Security Correspondent Jennifer Griffin takes a look tonight from the Pentagon. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REP. JIM HIMES (D-CT): It's by the awesome grace of God that we are not mourning dead pilots right now. JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice over): More fallout from the National Security text chain set up on Signal to discuss details of future operations to target the Houthis in Yemen. Defense Secretary Hegseth who was visiting troops in Hawaii spoke before departing for Guam. PETE HEGSETH, DEFENSE SECRETARY: Nobody is texting war plans. There's no units, no locations, no routes, no flight paths, no sources, no methods, no classified information. GRIFFIN (voice over): The texts were sent by the Defense Secretary two hours before the air strikes began. At 11:44 a.m. Eastern Time, Hegseth posted, weather is favorable. Just confirmed with CENTCOM. We are a go for mission launch. Then he went on to outline the operations future timeline, 1215 Eastern, F-18s launch, first strike package. 1415, strike drones on target. This is when the first bombs will definitely drop. 1536, F-18, second strike starts. Also first sea-based Tomahawks launched. Congressman Krishnamoorthi quoted from the DoD manual on classified information. REP. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL): Information shall be classified if its unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause describable damage to national security. This includes military plans, weapon systems or operations. LT. GEN. JEFFREY KRUSE, DIRECTOR OF THE DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE AGENCY: That's also an accurate quote. GRIFFIN (voice over): What was shared in the Signal group chat goes beyond war plans, because they included the timing of the operations. (END VIDEOTAPE) GRIFFIN (on camera): The Republican head of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Roger Wicker has called for an investigation and further hearings. ""The information as published recently, appears to me to be of such a sensitive nature that based on my knowledge, I would have wanted it classified."" Bret. BAIER: Jennifer Griffin live at the Pentagon. Jennifer, thanks. As Republicans look for ways to rein in federal judges hindering Trump administration policies, a divided federal appeals court is allowing a temporary stoppage of certain deportations, one of several cases we're following. Correspondent David Spunt is here with the latest. Good evening, David. DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Bret, good evening. The White House reacting Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt and her deputy, Harrison Fields, telling Fox News they will take this to the Supreme Court, reacting to this three judge panel that ordered that the administration must stop deporting suspected gang members using a 1798 law called the Alien Enemies Act. The original judge, Bret, in this case, ordered two planes -- two planes, administration officials insist were full of Venezuelan gang members to turn around. The planes did not and made it to El Salvador, where most of those aboard are in prison right now. This legal pause stays in place unless the Supreme Court gets involved, and the DOJ expected to do that, the White House says. And speaking of the Supreme Court, Bret, aside from this case, the administration asked the court twice this week to overturn a ruling by a lower court judge, the DOJ filed paperwork just this afternoon asking the nine justices to allow the Education Department to end about $600 million in federal teacher training grants. A group of eight states sued, saying that violates federal law. The administration once again going after lower court judges who have blocked the Trump agenda. Acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris writing, does a single district court judge who likely lacks jurisdiction have the unchecked power to compel the government of the United States to pay out and probably lose forever millions in taxpayer dollars? And today, a federal judge in Baltimore, Bret, said, he's likely to extend his prior order that directed 18 federal agencies to freeze firings and rehire some 25,000 probationary employees who were terminated as part of cost cutting DOGE measures. However, Judge James Bredar also said he's reluctant to impose a longer term national injunction, citing, ""Profound implications."" And earlier this week, the administration went to the Supreme Court asking the justices to overturn a similar ruling from a judge in San Francisco. So, two times they've gone to the Supreme Court officially this week and waiting on that third time now that they say they're going on this El Salvador plane issue. BAIER: A lot of moving parts cases. David, thank you. SPUNT: Thank you. BAIER: Well, meantime, the Supreme Court is upholding Biden era regulations targeting so called ghost guns. The justices ruling today, 7-2 to overturn a lower court's decision that the ATF exceeded its authority in issuing a rule targeting parts and kits for ghost guns. Ghost guns are do it yourself, functional weapons that are often purchased online and hard to trace. Four U.S. army soldiers have gone missing at a training area outside the capital of Lithuania, six miles from the border with Belarus. Statement from the military command in that region says the soldiers were conducting scheduled tactical training. The armored vehicle they were operating was found submerged in the nearby body of water. A search for those soldiers is underway, ongoing at this hour. Russia and Ukraine are accusing each other of breaking the terms of a U.S. broker deal to pause strikes on energy infrastructure and ensure safe navigation for ships in the Black Sea. Overnight attacks came hours after the agreement was announced, calling into question whether it will all hold. Correspondent Alex Hogan has the latest from London. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALEX HOGAN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Russia and Ukraine are both skeptical whether a Black Sea cease fire brokered by the U.S. will hold and want Washington to enforce the deal. LT. GEN. KEITH KELLOGG (RET.) SPECIAL ENVOY FOR UKRAINE AND RUSSIA: I think both want to tap out to a degree. They're just kind of looking to the referee, and that's going to be President Trump. HOGAN (voice over): Ukraine claims Russia launched heavy attacks on the Black Sea ports of Mykolaiv overnight, as well as on cities across Ukraine. Hours after the countries agreed to the Black Sea truce and a ban on hitting energy infrastructure. Today, Ukraine says Russia hit at least eight energy facilities since March 18th, when Russia first said it would halt those attacks. Russia accused Ukraine of launching drones over the Black Sea overnight. Moscow, however, argues yesterday's cease fire won't start until sanctions are lifted, citing restrictions on ships, companies producing and exporting food and a key agricultural bank. RUBIO: So, we're going to evaluate that, some of those conditions include sanctions that are not ours. They belong to the European Union. HOGAN (voice over): The Kremlin says it will never approve the proposal of sending European troops to monitor both sides, although it added, the recent negotiations are heading in the right direction. DMITRY PESKOV, KREMLINS SPOKESMAN (through translator): This is a good step forward, thanks to the constructive relations that have developed during our contacts with the American side. HOGAN (voice over): Still, President Donald Trump in an interview said that officials in Moscow could be dragging their feet. Today, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with French president Emmanuel Macron in Paris. Tomorrow, France will host leaders and delegates from roughly 30 countries for a so called Coalition of the Willing, to brainstorm long term security guarantees. (END VIDEOTAPE) HOGAN (on camera): Today, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent spoke on Fox News, saying that the U.S. has passed a new minerals deal to Ukraine, and that he expects discussions and even a signature next week, Bret. BAIER: Alex Hogan live in London. Alex, thank you. Up next, we get analysis from Brit Hume on the military plans leaked controversy and the fallout from that story. Keep it here. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: The United States is on track to hit its statutory debt ceiling, the so-called X-date, when the country runs short of money to pay its bills, as early as August. That's according to the Congressional Budget Office. By that time, the CBO projects -- or predicts, rather, the government would no longer have enough of a financial cushion to pay its bills. In order to prevent the default, Congress and the Trump administration would need to agree to lift the borrowing limit or abolish the debt ceiling concept altogether. One to track. Stocks were off today in response to new tariffs on the auto industry. The Dow lost 133. The S&P 500 fell 64. The NASDAQ dropped 373. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: As you know, I want to find if there is any mistake, or if Signal doesn't work -- it could be that Signal is not very good, you know, it's a company, maybe it's not very good. I think we'd rather know about it now. There was no harm done, because the attack was unbelievably successful that night. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: President, after that tariff event, talking asked, answering a question about the Signal plans and all of the controversy around that. Let's bring in Fox News chief political analyst Britt Hume. Brit, good evening. You know, this story -- (CROSSTALK) BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Hi, Bret. BAIER: 24 hours, 48 hours. Do you think it continues to last? HUME: It looks to me like it will, Bret, and there is some fairly well- established rules, if you can call them that, for how to deal with a situation like this. And the first is, get the facts out as fast as you can, and don't be afraid to take responsibility. And I actually think in early going, the administration did pretty well on that score. You know, Mike Waltz was forthright, saying that he took responsibility, and the president was as well, saying it was -- you know -- And -- but then, the second rule is, don't feed the story. So, you know, once you've got -- you've made your case about what happened, and you're maybe waiting for further information to service, just stop talking about it. But this administration got itself bogged down in this debate about whether there was war plans in there or not, or whether there was classified information there or not, and then, you had, you know, Tulsi Gabbard on Capitol Hill forced to say that, well, you know, this is the kind of information that was in that conversation that should be classified. And it -- so, that just kept the story going. The Democrats, of course, are having a field day, and so are the media. And the other thing they did is they attacked a journalist. Look, I'm not a particular fan of Goldberg or of his magazine, but he didn't do anything wrong here. You know, he got that -- he got that thing sent to him passively. He didn't do anything to get it. And then, when he -- when he -- reported on it, he left out a lot of the details. So, then they attacked him. And said that he wasn't telling the truth about it, which just gave him a reason to release the details, as he did this morning. So, rule one, doing OK. Rule two, not so much. BAIER: I mean, the president is now saying, we -- that we are forgetting the successful nature of this attack. The fact that they didn't think that this was put out all of these plans in detail. However, it does seem, and talking to people on Capitol Hill, that Democrats are holding on to this pretty significantly. HUME: Yes, they are. And some Republicans are raising questions about it too. And the fact is, the mission, apparently was successful, and all that's to the good, and it was reported on pretty heavily when it happened, and this came out later. Now, if you want to focus to be on that, then don't talk about this other stuff, about the -- about the Signal chat. So, the president can complain about that, but as long as they are feeding the story, he is going to get more of it. So -- and tonight, he was saying, you know, it wasn't a big deal or whatever. Stop talking about it, Mr. President. It will work better. BAIER: Well, to be fair, he is asked about it in these press availabilities, and does taken -- (CROSSTALK) HUME: Well, yes. Of course, he is. What you say is -- yes, the answer is asked -- (CROSSTALK) BAIER: Asked and answer. HUME: And I've said, well, I have to say about that for now, and now -- and when we -- when we know more later on, and we've fully investigated this, we'll get back to you. BAIER: But from your sense, do you see anybody losing their job over this? HUME: It doesn't appear so. And look, the fact to the matter is, that although, this looks pretty bad, and it should never have happened, and the information probably should have been classified, and all the rest of it. The fact is, it did not fall into hostile foreign hands. The mission went off successfully. So, no -- it was -- it would, did not turn out to be harmful in any meaningful way. It just looks bad. So, you know, I don't - I can see why the president wouldn't fire anybody over this. BAIER: Brit, as always. Thank you. Up next, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, goes beyond our borders in a quest for cooperation over deportations. Plus, Republicans question NPR and PBS amid efforts to cut government waste. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: President Trump's homeland security secretary is getting a first- hand look at the administration's deportation work. Secretary Kristi Noem, visiting an El Salvador mega prison, housing suspected gang members deported from the U.S. under the Alien Enemies Act. Correspondent Griff Jenkins has been following the story all day. Joins me with the latest as of this hour. Good evening, Griff. GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening. Bret. We have brand new video Secretary Noem just finished that tour of the Terrorism Confinement Center known as CECOT, currently housing more than 260 illegal aliens deported under that 1798 law, which a D.C. judge has now put the brakes on future flights. During the tour led by Salvadorian Justice Minister Gustavo Villatoro, Noem saw many alleged TDA gang members. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. KRISTI NOEM (R-SD): Do not come to our country illegally. You will be removed and you will be prosecuted. But know that this facility is one of the tools in our toolkit that we will use if you commit crimes against the American people. JENKINS (voice over): Now, right now, Noem is meeting with President Nayib Bukele to discuss how to increase deportation flights. Bukele agreed back in February to accept up to 300 criminal aliens at the cost of $6 million to house for up to a year, which the Border Patrol unions president says will serve as a deterrent. PAUL PEREZ, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, NATIONAL BORDER PATROL COUNCIL: That's going to have as a deterrent effect. Number one, it's going to make them think twice about coming into our country, because if they get caught, there is the high possibility that they are going to be sent there. (END VIDEO CLIP) JENKINS: Tomorrow, Noem heads to Colombia to meet with President Gustavo Petro and the Colombian National Police who specialize in targeting criminal organizations like TDA and M.S.-13. Then, she'll wrap the trip in Mexico with President Claudia Sheinbaum, who has struggled to defeat the Mexican cartels. Now, this as Fox obtains mug shots and rap sheets of more than 200 criminal aliens arrested by ice in Boston, including gang members, fentanyl traffickers, child rapists and murderers. And in Mexico, Bret, there will be pressure on President Sheinbaum to show progress on border enforcement with President Trump's April 2nd tariff deadline looming. Bret? BAIER: All right. Griff, thanks. The CEOs of PBS and NPR in the hot seat on Capitol Hill today, defending their organizations before the House DOGE subcommittee. Republicans, including President Trump, have criticized both outlets, claiming they are biased against conservatives. Senior national correspondent Aishah Hasnie has highlights from the Hill. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) AISHAH HASNIE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Tonight, the CEO of NPR, eating her own words about past disparaging tweets she wrote about President Trump. REP. TIM BURCHETT (R-TN): Why did you call President Trump a fascist and a deranged racist sociopath in 2020? KATHERINE MAHER, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO CEO: I regret those tweets. I would not tweet them again today. HASNIE: The public radio chief testifying alongside the CEO of PBS in front of the house DOGE Committee today as Republicans look to slash their federal funding. Katherine Maher, who skipped out on a hearing last year on allegations of bias, also admitted today -- MAHER: We were mistaken in failing to cover the Hunter Biden laptop story more aggressively and sooner. HASNIE: President Trump wants to defund NPR, calling it unfair, while Republicans say PBS airs inappropriate content for children, playing out this video of a drag queen. REP. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE (RGA): That's repulsive. That's not what children ages three to eight should ever be watching. HASNIE: PBS's Chief Paula Kerger explaining the show was put together by a New York City public broadcasting station and never actually aired during PBS's National Children's programming. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It was not for PBS. HASNIE: Democrats made light of the hearing. REP. ROBERT GARCIA (D-CA): Is Elmo now or has he ever been a member of the Communist Party of the United States? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No. HASNIE: And accused Republicans of ignoring more important oversight work. REP. GREG CASAR (D-TX): It's absurd. The total funding for public broadcasting is just one sixth the amount that Elon Musk's companies make off of the government every single year. (END VIDEOTAPE) HASNIE (on camera): So, Bret, if you're wondering when we might see House Republicans or Republicans in general defund things like NPR and PBS, well, they are looking at using either a rescissions package, we've heard that a lot, also working on putting DOGE cuts into appropriations. But the earliest that would happen would be September. Bret? BAIER: Aishah Hasnie live on the Hill, Aishah, thank you. Up next, one Democrat, one Republican seeking common ground at restoring American energy dominance. First, here's what some of our Fox affiliates around this country are covering tonight. Fox 45 in Baltimore, where Maryland leaders are honoring the six construction workers who were killed after the collapse of Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge. The catastrophe happened a year ago today. In an update last week, the NTSB blamed or placed the blame on Maryland's transportation authority citing a lack of risk evaluations. MDTA and Governor Wes Moore responded by saying it is the sole fault of the ship and its owners, and that a risk assessment is underway. Fox 5 in Atlanta, where Georgia's Senate committee is asking a judge to enforce a legislative subpoena against Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. The committee is investigating allegations of misconduct between Willis and her former special prosecutor, Nathan Wade, linked to the Georgia election interference case involving then former President Trump. And this is a live look at Chicago. One of the big stories there Tonight from Fox 32, our affiliate, a mega millions jackpot ticket worth $349 million sold in Illinois. The winning ticket was purchased in Courtland, about an hour west of Chicago. The winner has one year from the date of the drawing to claim that prize. Better look for that ticket. That's tonight's live look outside the beltway from Special Report. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [18:35:00] (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRIS WRIGHT, ENERGY SECRETARY: We have a lot of states in our country that don't have the advantage of low cost American energy, and that's because they made political choices for expensive energy. I don't think the citizens of those states realize that if you're paying very high prices, it's because the politicians in your state or surrounding states chose expensive energy policies. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Energy secretary there. Tonight, in our Common Ground segment, a pair of senators reaching across the aisle in support of a bill aimed at restoring American energy dominance through a cleaner source. Joining me tonight, Nebraska Republican Senator Deb Fischer and Illinois Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth. Thank you both for being here. You're both on this Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, but you also serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee. And I want to start with the breaking news out of today and your reaction to this Signal story. Senator Wicker has announced this investigation. What's your thoughts first, Senator Fisher? SEN. DEB FISCHER (R-NE): Well, we always have to have the safety of our military men and women, paramount. That's a concern. And anytime you have, I think, a discussion that should be held in a classified setting have that in an unclassified setting, that's a danger. It's a danger to our service members. It puts them in harm's way. It can lead to our adversaries knowing the locations they're in, and also the detail of plans. So, that's obviously a concern. BAIER: Senator Duckworth, your statement today was pretty pointed. You said, Pete Hegseth is an effing liar. This is so clearly classified info he recklessly leaked that could have gotten our pilots killed. You say he needs to resign. Here is Secretary Hegseth dealing with those questions today. [18:40:02] (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PETE HEGSETH, DEFENSE SECRETARY: Nobody's texting or plans. There's no units, no locations, no routes, no flight paths, no sources, no methods, no classified information. You know who sees war plans? I see them every single day. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: So, you think he should step down? SEN. TAMMY DUCKWORTH (D-IL): I do. Because what he texted was the drones are going to hit, then the second sortie of F-18s will be on target. That tells the enemy exactly when the drones hit in that spot, 30 minutes later, the F-18s are going to be there. That is my concern. That's why I'm so upset as a former pilot. You know, I have a special affinity for pilots who are out there, and these men and women, thank goodness, you know, were not injured on this mission. And I worry about future missions. I worry that our allies might not share information with us if they feel that we do not know how to safeguard. So, I really want to thank Chairman Wicker for agreeing to do this investigation. I think a bipartisan, nonpartisan investigation is what is needed. BAIER: I've noticed Democrats using expletives a little bit more in statements. Is that why you decided to use that? DUCKWORTH: I'm an Army helicopter pilot. I'm a grunt pilot. It was -- you know, I have known to have a little bit of a potty mouth, unfortunately. BAIER: We'll see where this goes. Obviously, this investigation will go forward. The president and the national security adviser both said it was a mistake and they're moving forward. But Senator Wicker is doing this investigation along with Senator Reed, bipartisan. Now, I want to talk about this bill, and what is really about is amending the Clean Air Act. Explain that, Senator Fischer. FISCHER: Well, right now we have a patchwork of regulations for E15. And we want to be able to have a year round sale of E15. It's not a mandate. It's an option that our gas stations can use. It's not -- BAIER: It's a mixture of ethanol. FISCHER: Right. It's a mixture of ethanol, 15 percent. And it helps a number of different entities. Obviously, we look at it because it helps consumers. It's cheaper at the pump. It's a clean fuel. It helps our corn farmers in Illinois and in Nebraska. We have a huge group of stakeholders from our oil companies. You know, big oil hasn't always been a fan of E15, but they realize the benefits of it now too. So, the American Petroleum Institute, the refineries, our convenience stores, we have a lot of momentum on this and we just want to be able to get it done. I've introduced it every year for the last 11 years. So, we're working on it. BAIER: So, what got you together working on this? The fuel prices -- FISCHER: Senator Duckworth is a warrior. You know, you learned that with the potty mouth comment. But Senator Duckworth is a warrior and I'm just really, really fortunate to have her as my partner on this bill so we can get it done. BAIER: I mentioned fuel prices if unleaded gasoline at $3.15, E15 at $2.76, that's one of the benefits, obviously. Senator Duckworth, what's taken so long on this, you think? DUCKWORTH: Well, it's just been hard to get it across the finish line. And this is something that the Trump administration, the first Trump administration worked on this. We worked on this on the Biden administration. This is something we've been working on every single year. I think we've gone to a place now where we have consensus, where people, especially the oil refineries, have realized they actually sell more gas if they actually blend in more E15, because the demand goes up, people will buy and travel more. And so this, in the long run, is really good for the consumer. It's also good for our ag sector. Our farmers need all the help they can get. They're really facing some headwinds right now. And so year-round E15 is what is needed. It's going to be good for everybody. And it just took a while to get the oil folks on board. BAIER: Yes. So, this is one of the things you're working on, but there are other things that you all work together on up on Capitol Hill. Obviously, Armed Services is a bipartisan effort usually, although you're on different sides sometimes. FISCHER: Yes, we have a great working relationship. And Tammy and I being on Armed Services, we've been together and the committee has been together on so many, many issues so that we all have that common goal of protecting this country and making sure that we are secure and safe in this country. And I think that is sometimes not reported on enough and people need to know. So, I thank you for doing segments like this. BAIER: Yes, we've been doing common ground for almost 18 months now. But Senator Duckworth, there's other things, even though the heated politics can get pretty hot up there, right? DUCKWORTH: It can get pretty hot, you know, but, really, we are friends and we get along. We don't always vote the same way and we might oppose each other, but especially in Armed Services Committee, I think we'll sit down during that bill writing process, during the debate process, and oftentimes we will come to a place where, you know, we get to consensus, where I get 80 percent of what I want, you get 80 percent of what you want and it helps America. [18:45:03] Again, we both want the same thing. We love this country and I assume that Deb loves this country as much as I love this country often, but sometimes we loo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 so we're going to have slightly different answers. But as long as we get to a place where we support America, support our farmers, protect our military men and women, and keep our promise to veterans, we're going to be in agreement all day long. BAIER: Well, senators, thanks so much for the time. We really appreciate it. DUCKWORTH: Thank you. BAIER: You can see all the Common Ground segments on my podcast Common Ground. Find that in the All-Star Panel podcast under the Bret Baier Up next, the panel on the fallout of the accidental messaging, plus the president's new tariffs today and what he said about them. And then a major guest and some of his team join Special Report tomorrow from the White House, (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [18:50:00] (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, U.S. PRESIDENT: We are losing all of our plants. They were being built in Mexico and Canada and other places. Now, those plants largely have stopped and they're moving them to our country. It will effectively be charging a 25 percent tariff, but if you build your car in the United States, there is no tariff. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: So, the president announcing 25 percent tariff on all cars built outside the us what he said ahead of Liberation day, which is April 2nd, when these other reciprocal tariffs all around the world will kick in. Let's bring in our panel Ben Domench, editor-at-large for The Spectator, host of the Ben Domenech podcast on Fox News Radio, Josh Kaushaar, Fox News Radio political analyst, and Olivia Beavers of The Wall Street Journal. Okay, Olivia, obviously the market has been jittery about all of this, little bit of a down day today, but really the big effort's going to be April 2nd. OLIVIA BEAVERS, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Yes. And I think, you know, Republicans that I've been talking to on the hill, they're feeling a little bit queasy. They're waiting to see how this turns out because the president first like zooms in and pulls back. And today there were tariffs on foreign-made cars. But they're waiting to see if there's a broader response. And some of the Republicans I talked to say that they're hearing from constituents across the board of different kind of businesses who are worried about the impact. Now, that's not across the board, but this might be an area where you see them elevating these concerns to the White House saying, hey, you're hurting our people back home. Can you pull back on this? BAIER: Ben? BEN DOMENECH, FOX NEWS RADIO HOST: Yes, I've talked to some people within the auto industry about this, you know, running up in anticipation of this. And one of the things that I think is understandable is to just sort of say, you know, look, if we're going to have this type of shift, it's going to be a fundamental shift, one that, you know, really does bring back home the kind of jobs that the president has promised, you know, in the past over time. But in the immediate, it's going to cause significant disruption. There's going to be all sorts of reaction to it, and we'll see how this plays out in the coming days. But, you know, it's certainly another example of president doubling down on a policy that he has pursued and endorsed throughout his career. BAIER: Yes, Josh, every time he talks about it, he talks about the number of dollars they're going to get from this, but also the long-term impacts he says will bring companies back here to avoid tariffs overall. That's the plan. But I don't think he's shied away from the fact that it may be disruptive at the beginning. JOSH KRAUSHAAR, FOX NEWS RADIO POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes, it's a big political gamble. Look, President Trump has made his political career in support of tariffs. That's one way he was unique as a Republican candidate in the first place. But at a time when a lot of Americans are worried about higher prices, even allies of the president acknowledge that people trying to buy a car are going to pay higher prices. A lot of American cars are manufactured overseas, so it doesn't matter what car you buy, there's going to be an inflationary effect as a result of these tariffs. Now, I think the goal is to bring more manufacturing back into the country. That's a longer term proposition. And if people are upset about rising price of cars, of inflation, he may not have time to accomplish the bigger goal, which is a worthy goal and one that his administration has really focused on. BAIER: Meanwhile, a lot of the oxygen in the room today was obviously on this Signal and The Atlantic piece that published everything that was put out there, reaction on Capitol Hill all day. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TULSI GABBARD, NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE DIRECTOR: It was a mistake that a reporter was inadvertently added to a signal chat with high level national security principles. REP. JIM HIMES (D-CT): I think that it's by the awesome grace of God that we are not mourning dead pilots right now. SEN. TOM COTTON (R-AT): It was certainly not war plans, as it was exaggerated or embellished to be said. REP. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL): Secretary Hegseth has disclosed military plans as well as classified information. He needs to resign immediately. TRUMP: There was no harm done because the attack was unbelievably successful that night, and it has been unbelievably successful every single night, for the last four or five nights. So -- and that's the thing that you should be talking about. Look, it's all a witch hunt. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: All a witch hunt, Ben. It is taking a lot of focus but you've had Democrats and Republicans weigh in now. DOMENECH: Look, there are a couple things going on here. One is that I should just say if the worst case scenario for the White House is that a reporter who already hates them gets a couple of good news cycles out of it, I think they should be very thankful in this circumstance. Look, this was a mistake and it was a significant one. I think you're also dealing with a circumstance here where it's not lost on me that a number of these members of this text conversation are all former members of Congress, okay, who all use Signal in these encrypted apps to communicate when it comes to policy discussions, which is what was actually going on in this conversation. [18:55:15] It was a policy debate, and that's the kind of thing that they're used to. That's because Donald Trump has frankly hired a lot of people into his foreign policy and national security side who are people who are used to busting down doors as opposed to taking briefings. This is also something, though, I think that this White House needs to learn from. You do need operational security on these matters going forward. They should be very grateful that they did not have some bad outcome coming out of it. It was a very successful, you know, operation and I think that they should learn from it. BAIER: Yes. And, you know, they said at the beginning it was a mistake. We're going to go forward. The president said, we probably aren't going to use Signal anymore. But how -- DOMENECH: Any of the members of the military, by the way, who may be having to delete that off their phones. BAIER: How -- yes. How, Olivia, they dealt with it as far as the pushback and the communication, to Britt's (ph) point earlier, seemed like it may have given it another cycle. BEAVERS: Certainly. And it seems like they are contorting in the way that I used to try to fit into high school jeans. You know, they're trying to make it fit, work in a narrative, downplaying, dismissing, and it's prolonging the problem. And I was talking to Republicans on the Hill about this today. Well, they might be having these talking points about how Hillary Clinton and Democrats mishandled it. Behind the scenes, they are being very critical saying, how was that not classified information? Of course, that's still the question we're trying to get answers about. But -- and the White House is dismissing that it is, but experts at The Wall Street Journal talk to say that the attack plans that were included are usually classified. BAIER: Well, you heard Deb Fischer, you've seen Roger Wicker, Josh, in a bipartisan investigation that's going forward. I think he's calling for the inspector general to look into it. KRAUSHAAR: Yes, I think that might be one of the biggest developments of the day that Roger Wicker head of the Senate Armed Services Committee is not towing the line, is actually saying there will be an investigation. And, look, the cover-up always can be as bad as the crime. I think that the revealing national security secrets on Signal obviously not a good thing, but when you're parsing, you know, war plans versus attack plans, you're claiming that, you know, the secrets aren't actually not classified information, that the defense secretary has the right to classify an unclassify things at will, you're not being the most credible spokespeople on the on, on the international stage. So, I think, you know, I think Britt was right. Apologize. You made a mistake. People make mistakes and move on. DOMENECH: Let me just point out that you add a bunch of people, as you have in this administration who want to move fast and break things, you're going to get some cowboy attitude with that that's going to have the risk of something like this, which is why you need to prioritize making sure that it doesn't happen again. BAIER: Yes. And make sure there's not a journalist on your list. DOMENECH: Yes, I think that's a good idea. BAIER: All right. Let's go to Capitol Hill, NPR and PBS testifying up there. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JAMES COMER (R-KY): I don't even recognize the station anymore. It's not news. I feel like it's propaganda. I feel like there's disinformation every time I listen to NPR. REP. JASMINE CROCKETT (D-TX): The Republicans have actually organized this goofy hearing to try to convince the American people that PBS and NPR are, quote, domestic terrorist or domestic threats, my apologies, not the incompetent, unqualified secretary of defense whose texting war plan -- who's texting more plans to journalists? (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Jasmine Crockett is in every news cycle for some reason, Olivia. But the bottom line here is that there's a real funding question over NPR and PBS, and that's what this DOGE subcommittee dealt with today. BEAVERS: It was. And you saw sort of a split screen where you had Republicans arguing that it's a waste to keep them funded, that the media horizons already oversaturated, and then NPR and PBS to defending their existence as very important, saying they're reaching rural communities, and also just saying that their existence matters, that they have the trust of 60 percent, which was the NPR chief's message. Now, did that turn into kind of a very intense attack? Yes. But Republicans also got some concessions about coverage, whether it was about COVID, the Hunter Biden laptop. So they did have some messaging wins there. BAIER: Josh? KRAUSHAAR: Yes. I thought it was really interesting that a lot of the congressmen who were questioning the NPR CEO for some of the tweets she made in 2020 defending writing, you know, pure wokeness and undiluted. And it reminds you how far the politics have come from that moment in 2020 where the head of NPR had a gumption to say these radical things and now she's apologizing and walking them back. DOMENECH: As an original tote bag-owning listener to NPR, I'm disappointed in what they've been, and I think that the performance today in front of the committee is not going to do anything to avert Republicans going after their funding going forward. BAIER: All right, panel, thanks. Tomorrow's Special Report, we will be at the White House and I will interview Elon Musk and some top members of the Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE, discussing their efforts in cracking down on waste, fraud, and abuse. [19:00:02] You can send questions if you'd like to social media. Shoot me a post or message on X or Instagram @bretbaier. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for this Special Report. Fair, balanced and still unafraid," the Ingraham Angle starts right now.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hopefully, we'll be getting more information over the weekend about what exactly caused this crash and why. Thanks for joining us. BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Good evening. I'm Bret Baier. Multiple sources tell Fox News, FBI agents and employees across the country are being fired tonight, told to retire or quit as the major purge at the bureau hits an inflection point. A watershed moment, over the fight for control of the Panama Canal, as Secretary of State Marco Rubio prepares to visit the waterway. And we will discuss the Trump administration plan to end the war in Ukraine with his special envoy to Russia and Ukraine, retired Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg. But first, ""BREAKING TONIGHT"", White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, says President Trump's intent on increasing staffing at air safety agencies. The statement coming as the president is questioning whether the air traffic controller on duty when the American Airlines regional jet and the Army Black Hawk helicopter collided near Washington was a Diversity Equity and Inclusion hire. This comes, as officials, as you just heard at the National Transportation Safety Board, say the black box from the Black Hawk helicopter has been recovered. The 64 people aboard the plane and the three soldiers on the helicopter all died. Multiple other investigations are underway. For the latest, we turn to correspondent Alexandria Hoff, starting us off tonight, live from the North Lawn. Good evening, Alex. ALEXANDRIA HOFF, FOX NEWS CHANNEL WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. Yes. Today, the president expressed concern over the height that the military Black Hawk was flying over that corridor of the Potomac, saying it was far above the 200 feet allowed. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The Black Hawk was too high - - HOFF (voice over): President Trump, joined by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, signed additional executive action relating to reducing regulation. There, he was pressed on comments he had made about DEI hiring, potentially contributing to Wednesday's deadly air collision. TRUMP: I like to put it up front. We have to have the best people, the smartest people, the sharpest people, as control tower experts, and that's what they have to be. HOFF (voice over): This afternoon, 13 democratic state attorneys general signed a statement, calling the president's claims baseless and an insult to those who are grieving and the individuals serving in the military and air traffic control. The White House reiterating the president's position. KAROLINE LEAVITT, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: OK. We certainly have seen the deterioration of federal hiring standards at the Federal Aviation Administration. And the president wants to increase those standards, he wants pilots in this country. He have the great responsibility of flying American citizens by the tens of millions every single day. TRUMP: We're going to the winter White House. We're going to be working all weekend, and we'll see you down there. HOFF (voice over): Before departing to spend the weekend at Mar-a-Lago, President Trump met with the CEO of advanced computer chip maker, Nvidia. TRUMP: We had a meeting. It was good meeting. HOFF (voice over): Stock was rattled by China's A.I. startup, DeepSeek. TRUMP: Eventually, we're going to put tariffs on chips. We're going to put tariffs on oil and gas. That will happen fairly soon. Think around the 18th of February. (END VIDEOTAPE) HOFF (on camera): And President Trump did say that the tariffs he plans to impose on China, Mexico, and Canada tomorrow could have an impact on American consumers, saying that if that is the case, he calls it a temporary, short-term disruption. Bret. BAIER: Alex, a federal judge granted a temporary restraining order on the federal spending freeze. What more do we know about that? HOFF: Well, Bret, there are two cases that are happening right now regarding those federal funds. This one pertains to the 22 states that have filed suit over the fact that their claim is that this freeze is harming their residents in those states. Now, the judge ended up siding with the states because they say, while the White House argued they had rescinded the memo on freezing the funds, that they never actually rescinded it, the judge actually cited an ex-post by White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, saying that it was still in full force. He therefore, granted this temporary restraining order so that they cannot freeze these funds. Now, the big question right now is Bret, if the White House does not honor that order, really, what does that mean in terms of how the federal judge's orders are respected. What does it mean for the Constitution? I mean, a lot of that is in flux right now. Bret. BAIER: Alexandria Hoff, live at the North Lawn. Alex, thanks. Police boats are scouring the Potomac River, looking for remains of victims. Tonight, we have new information on recovery efforts and some of those victims. Correspondent Griff Jenkins has the latest from Reagan National Airport. Good evening, Griff. GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: And good evening, Bret. Significant news coming out of that NTSB press conference just moments ago, all three black boxes have been found. Two from the CRJ-700 airplane, one from that Sikorsky Black Hawk that may give us more clues. And in TSP, saying that interviews with air traffic control employees have begun, and that will be a significant development. Meanwhile, as you mentioned, out on the Potomac, in rough conditions, recovery crews have been working. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JENKINS (voice over): Recovery crews worked aggressively in rain and dense fog, searching for more bodies. JOHN DONNELLY, CHIEF, D.C. FIRE AND EMS DEPARTMENT: For us to recover the rest of the remains that we are going to need to get the fuselage out of the water. A lot of our operations today are focused on the helicopter. JENKINS (voice over): D.C.'s fire and EMS chief, also delivering a somber update. DONNELLY: We have recovered 41 sets of the remains, and 28 of those victims have been positively identified. JENKINS (voice over): This, as we learn more about the victims. Howard University law professor Kiah Duggins was a civil rights attorney and former Miss Kansas contestant. The university remembered her in a statement, saying, she dedicated her career to fighting against unconstitutional policing and unjust money bail practices. Asra Hussain was traveling home from a work trip. She texted her husband before the crash, he was waiting at the airport to pick her up. We're also learning more about the members of the figure skating community that were on the plane. Cory Haynos was flying home with his parents, Roger and Stephanie. Everly and Alydia were two sisters who loved to skate. Their dad even set up an ice-skating rink for them in their yard. The sisters were traveling back from the competition with their parents, Donna and Peter. And the second pilot of the helicopter has been identified as Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39 years old, from Great Mills, Maryland. The name of the third soldier is not being released at the request of the family. (END VIDEOTAPE) JENKINS (on camera): And Bret, the NTSB said that we should soon see barges arriving from Virginia Beach out in the Potomac to begin salvage operations, which may include pulling the fuselages out of the water, believing there could be some remains contained inside those. Bret. BAIER: Griff Jenkins at Reagan National. Griff, thank you. Also ""BREAKING TONIGHT"", FBI agents and employees across the country were fired, told to retire, or quit over the past few days. More we're told, are in the works. It's setting up what could be a major legal battle for the president. Correspondent David Spunt shows us tonight. Good evening, David. DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Bret, good evening. Multiple sources tell Fox News the top levels of the FBI, down to the agents who work the streets, are being told, as you said, to quit, retire, or be fired. They say they are not being provided with specific reasons. Just told it's time to go. One source says it could be at least 100 people and possibly more. And this is across the country, not just in Washington. Fox has told, senior interim leaders at the FBI are compiling a list of agents and others involved in the two federal prosecutions, involving then- former President Trump, the classified documents raid on Mar-a-Lago in August 2022, and the election interference case. One source said these agents were simply following investigative leads and doing their jobs. The president denied involvement or knowledge about this purge this afternoon, when asked in the Oval Office. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: I wasn't involved in it. I'll have to see what is exactly going on after this is finished. But if they fired, some people over there, that's a good thing, because they were very bad. They were very corrupt people. Very corrupt, and they hurt our country very badly with the weaponization. (END VIDEO CLIP) SPUNT: The FBI Agents Association telling Fox News tonight, ""Dismissing potentially hundreds of agents would severely weaken the bureau's ability to protect the country from national security and criminal threats, and will ultimately risk, setting up the bureau and its new leadership for failure."" The president's nominee for FBI Director Kash Patel, yesterday, pledged in front of a Senate panel not to retaliate once he's in office, assuming he's confirmed. But if a large purge does happen before he is confirmed, he can come in, live up to his pledge. Bret, we are also learning, I've just confirmed this via a source, just moments ago, that the justice department, top officials there are actually in the process of firing prosecutors that were going after January 6. People that were involved and charged with crimes involving the January 6 attack on the Capitol. So, that's coming in across the street from the FBI that senior DOJ officials are firing -- in the process of firing some of those prosecutors who went after those January 6 rioters. Busy night, Bret. BAIER: Busy, indeed. David, thanks. SPUNT: Thanks. BAIER: A Trump administration official telling Fox News tonight that the administration is putting a pause on most federal government web sites. Those websites were expected to go dark 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time. The official saying, it's intended to clean up DEI content and any anti Trump administration content on those sites. Stocks were off over the tariff news we talked about earlier. The Dow lost 337. The S&P-500 fell 31. The NASDAQ dropped 54. For the week, the Dow was up a quarter of a percentage point. The S&P 500 was off one percent, the Nasdaq fell 1-2/3. Up next, President Trump's special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, retired Army Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg, joins us live on the Trump administration approach to end that war. First, here is what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. FOX5 in New York as bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, it resolves a lawsuit against a venture capital firm co-founded by a former aide in Hillary Clinton's office. The settlement with K5 Global paves the way for the parties to collaborate to maximize recoveries for FTX customers and stakeholders. The crypto exchanges collapse in November of '22 left many customers unable to access their funds. FOX2 in San Francisco, as a federal appeals court orders the city to rehire two former workers who left due to COVID vaccination requirements. The pair of both Christians who objected to taking the vaccines. And this is a live look at Kansas City, one of the big stories there tonight from FOX4. Multiple sources telling our affiliate that if the Kansas City Chiefs win the Super Bowl next weekend, there will be no rally for the public. This comes as after a mass shooting at last year's Super Bowl rally in Kansas City. A parade would still be held. Chiefs will try to make history next Sunday when they take on the Philadelphia Eagles by becoming the first team to win three consecutive Super Bowls. Of course, you can catch the Super Bowl. Super Bowl LIX on Fox. That's tonight's live look, ""OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY"" from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: President Trump says the 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico and the 10 percent on China will take effect tomorrow, and that they are not a negotiating tactic in his words. The president suggesting he will try to blunt the impact on oil imports. Let's take a closer look with Fox Business Correspondent Lydia Hu, she joins us tonight from Calgary. Lydia, good evening. LYDIA HU, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Good evening there, Bret. President Trump announced this afternoon that he would likely reduce the amount of the tariff expected on Canadian oil to 10 percent, this would be an exception to the more broad 25 percent tariff expected to go into effect on all products imported from Canada and Mexico. It's important because Canada is the United States' largest trading partner. Roughly 13 percent of all products imported into the United States come from Canada. So, think about that, more than one out of 10 imported products are of Canadian origin, and much of that is oil. Oil makes up about one fifth of the Canadian imports. Even though the United States is the world's largest oil producer, we consume 19 million barrels per day, according to the Energy Information Administration, we exceed the 13 million barrels per day we produce, and that's why we import roughly 6.5 million barrels every day, and nearly 3.9 million come from Canada. We spoke with the CEO of Cenovus Energy, a major oil producer, here in Calgary, about the possibility of the oil tariffs. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JON MCKENZIE, CEO, CENOVUS ENERGY: If you just do the rough math in your head, a 25 percent tariff is kind of $15.00 a barrel. Well, somebody has got to pay for that. It's either got to be the producer, you know, the refiner, or the customer. (END VIDEO CLIP) HU: A barrel of Canada's oil trades at a discount to American oil today, trading $13.00 less than American oil. This allows the U.S. to buy the Canadian oil at a discount and sell our more expensive American oil on the market. And a tariff would erode that advantage. That's the concern. Outside of oil, Bret, more than $320 billion worth of Canadian goods could be subject to tariffs starting tomorrow that is everything from cars and auto parts, food and even minerals. Back to you. BAIER: Lydia Hu in Calgary. Lydia, thank you. Hamas is set to release three more hostages this weekend as part of its cease fire deal with Israel, that will include AmericanIsraeli Keith Siegel and FrenchIsraeli citizens Ofer Calderon and Yarden Bibas. Siegel will be the first American citizen taken captive during Hamas' brutal surprise attacks on October 7th, 2023 to be released by the terror organization. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Two years is a long time -- two years is a long time. I know you feel it. I've talked to people in your streets who feel it. So, when does it end? VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (voice over): Probably, I think it's not very fair to ask Ukrainians when the war will finish. Let's be frank, the world is not really ready for Putin to be able to lose his power. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: That was February. I was in Ukraine interviewing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the anniversary of the war. We're coming up on the third anniversary of the war. President Zelenskyy just talked to Sean Hannity the other night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ZELENSKYY: President Trump has the will to force Putin to come to peace. He can do it. And if the U.S. considers pressure on Putin, involving other countries, global south and China, I'm sure that an agreement can be made. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Agreement can be made. The Russia-Ukraine war is ongoing. Today, Russia claimed to have captured another village in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine. Let's discuss with President Trump's Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Retired Army Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg. LT. GEN. KEITH KELLOGG (RET.), SPECIAL ENVOY FOR UKRAINE AND RUSSIA: General, thanks for the time. KELLOGG: Thanks, Bret. Thanks for having me. BAIER: I know you've been talking to the president and the national security team about what they want to do, what they think is possible. Where are you tonight on the possibility of getting both sides to the negotiating table? KELLOGG: Well, I have a lot of confidence, Bret, in President Trump. You know, he's a deal maker. He's going to make it happen. He's talked about back in September when he had President Zelenskyy in Trump Tower, when he said, it's time to do it. We've had good coordination with the Vice President, Secretary Rubio, Pete Hegseth, National Security Advisor. You know, everybody's pulling together on this one. And it's important because we realize it's actually in our national security interest to get this war resolved. When you look at that money that United States has provided, which is over $174 billion, when you look at the alliance that is now formed with Russia, with North Korea, with China and Iran, that wasn't there before, it's now together, and they've got either economic or peace treaty signed between both of them out there. Yesterday, you've seen North Korean troops on the battlefield near Kursk in Russia itself, and fighting Ukrainians. And I think we have a good, solid plan to go forward, to start talking and working it through there. And you know, one thing I've noticed being with President Trump before is, you know, sort of like on NFL draft day when they say, OK, the Atlantic Falcons, you're on the clock. Well, I like to think I'm on the clock and I'm on the clock for the American people. I'm on the clock for President Trump, and he wants to get it done. He realizes that this is the wolf closest to the sled when it comes to international relations. And I think we're going to head in that direction. And I feel very, very confident that we can actually make something happen. President Trump will lead this effort and the good thing about it, he's a great deal maker, and he's very confident what he's going to do. And I have great confidence that we can pull this off for the American people and for the world. And I think -- I think they're ready. I think Europe's ready for it as well. BAIER: General, we put up that map, and the map really hasn't changed. As far as areas being controlled, there have been some counter offensives by the Ukrainians in the blue area there, but the red has really been the same for a year plus for Russian control. If you look at the headlines, with Trump's return, Ukraine renews a push to seize Russia's frozen billions. North Korean troops no longer seen on the front lines fighting Ukraine. Germany's Budget Committee wants to appoint some three billion euros for Ukraine sources. A lot of people are wondering whether the Trump administration is going to continue to fund weapons in the short term for Ukraine, or continue to push Vladimir Putin and Russia with additional sanctions to try to put the pinch on them to get them to the table. KELLOGG: Yes, and Bret, that's going to be up to the president of the United States what he wants to do. That's his call as the leader of our nation. But look, what we see out there, and what's happened before with the previous administration. You know, when they had a strategy of as long as it takes, as much as it takes, that's really not a strategy as a bumper sticker. But when you look at this, let's use the sanctions as a great example, the recent sanctions, if you go on a grading of one to 10, 10 being the toughest, one being the easiest. You know, I think when it comes to the sanctions were probably only the sixth, but the enforcement is only about a three. You know, like, for example, we have sanctioned the ghost fleet, not just by the fleet, but by, actually by the hulls, the ships themselves. And yet, we've really not addressed that, because that's carrying almost 70 percent of the oil, the illicit oil that's going overseas from Russia. That's where they get their money. It's petrodollars. These are the kind of things we're looking at talking about. How do we apply pressures, not only the Russians and incentives as well, but also to the Ukrainians, we're going to give them incentives and pressure points as well. And give the president of the United States leverage to complete that. And that's what we're doing, and going through the process, talking about it, getting the team on board. BAIER: So, let me just read between the lines here. It's possible that you're going to enforce the sanctions more that are already in place, or maybe add more. And is it possible that the weapons are still going to flow to Ukraine in the short term? KELLOGG: I would say that's up to the president of the United States, what he is going to do. That's his call, but if -- but I think most people should be very comfortable in the fact that he knows exactly what he's doing. He knows where to apply pressure, where not to apply pressure. But more importantly, that he will create leverage, and leverage both with Ukrainians and the Russians. And you can read between the lines on that is how, in fact, you create leverage. He's a great deal maker. He knows that. He knows how to apply leverage, and that's one of the things we are talking about with him, and giving him the options to do what he wants to do as president. BAIER: But you've been around the block, General. I mean, do you think this is months? What do you think this is? KELLOGG: You know, I would like to say it's months, but it's not years. I'm talking about, you know, I'd like to think that we could have something in the short term. What I mean by the short term? I've said this before on one of your programs, on one Fox programs, I'd like to see it count down from a hundred days back and figure out where we're at, either ceasefire or permanent peace. And I think it's all in the art of the doable. But this is going to be sort of like we saw in Afghanistan, which is four years, it's not a cottage industry. It's got to be something short term for both nations. But not only just for both nations. It's good for the United States. It's good for the world as well if we can stop this fight, stop the killing, which has been horrific, and stop the destruction of the Ukrainian cities. Look, when you look at cities in Ukraine, like, Bret, like a miracle, a city the size of Denver and or Atlanta, Atlanta proper. It's a totally destroyed city of 500,000. When you look at the deaths, when you count the deaths of the Ukraine military, of the Ukrainian in the -- in the Russian and then you add that with the wounded, you're talking over a million soldiers, killer wounded in action. Those are horrific numbers. Those are World War II level numbers. And I think the president has it right. It's time to stop it. It's time to stop the killing. It's time to come down for peace on both sides. And I think it's going to be important. It's important for the world, it's important for the region, and it's important for us as the United States and our national interests as well. BAIER: General Kellogg, we appreciate you coming on. We welcome you back with any details as you get them. Thank you. KELLOGG: Thanks, Bret. BAIER: What we know and are looking to find out in the military investigation into the air tragedy over Washington. And then, an exclusive nighttime helicopter ride along as federal agents scout the southern border. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: A military investigation is underway focusing on the movements of the Army Black Hawk helicopter involved in the midair collision near Washington. Senior national correspondent relationship Rich Edson has the latest from the Pentagon. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS STATE DEPARTMENT CORRESPONDENT: The Pentagon says its investigation in the Black Hawk helicopter that struck a commercial jet is focused on altitude. PETE HEGSETH, DEFENSE SECRETARY: Was the Black Hawk too high? Was it on course? Right now we don't quite know. EDSON: This morning President Trump posted on social media that, quote, ""The Black Hawk helicopter was flying too high by a lot. It was far above the 200-foot limit. That's not really too complicated to understand, is it?"" Investigators announced this evening that they had recovered the helicopter's black box which officials say will help them understand what the pilots were saying and who was in control leading up to the crash. CAPT. ARMEN KURDIAN (RET), SEARCH AND RESCUE EXPERT: Those black boxes are absolute wealth of operation. Were the engines operating normally? Was the GPS operating normally? Was the flight computer on? Were all the displays working? What were the last control inputs that the pilots actually did? EDSON: The Pentagon described Wednesday's Black Hawk flight as part of routine nighttime training, so the pilots could fly through airspace they'd navigate in their jobs transporting some of the most senior federal officials. HEGSETH: There are many things that happen in and around the capital that ensure in a contingency, in an emergency, our government is able to continue to operate. You need to rehearse in ways that would reflect a real world scenario. EDSON: This afternoon the FAA announced that it will, quote, ""restrict helicopter traffic in the area over the Potomac River around Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport."" The restriction exempts helicopters entering this airspace for live saving medical support, active law enforcement, active air defense, or president transport helicopter missions. (END VIDEO TAPE) EDSON (on camera): An FAA database has 30 records of near midair misses at Reagan National Airport since 1987. Of those, 10 involved military aircraft, seven involved military helicopters. Bret? BAIER: Rich Edson live at the Pentagon. Rich, thanks. Also breaking tonight, two illegal immigrant suspects are now charged with murder in relation to the death of 63-year-old man whose body was tied up in his home in Chicago late Sunday. An autopsy determined he died of multiple injuries related to that assault. The adult migrants are believed to have crossed into the United States through the Texas border in the summer of 2023. FOX News on the front lines. Tonight, we take you on an exclusive nighttime helicopter patrol at the southern border as federal agents deploy advanced technology to uncover migrants and smugglers. Correspondent Brooke Taylor shows us from El Paso. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) BROOKE TAYLOR, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: FOX News gets an exclusive helicopter ride in the El Paso sector above one of the busiest areas known for illegal migrant crossings and got-aways. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We just picked up two more that just crossed the Normandy (ph) barriers that they just put up. TAYLOR: Agents with the air and marine operations show us how they help Border Patrol agents on the ground catch migrants in the darkest of hours. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They're trying to run, yep. TAYLOR: Including this one who tried to hide in the brush and make a run for it before being caught. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That guy is still messing with the fence right there. TAYLOR: Two migrant groups just made a hole in the border wall. It's dark out, so what they don't realize we're five miles away and can still watch their every move. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He was kind of halfway through the fence there. TAYLOR: The agents wearing night vision goggles are watching a live camera feed with a mapping software system which allows them to know exactly where the migrants are. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Those two are crawling away. TAYLOR: The agents also have a laser invisible to the naked eye, using it to guide Border Patrol agents. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Keep coming, keep coming, keep coming. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Keep rolling, keep rolling until your stop. Keep going for another 25 yards. TAYLOR: Our camera crew on the ground then captured agents apprehending a 19-year-old from Mexico and another man from Guatemala. HAMID NIKSERESHT, U.S. BORDER PATROL SPECIAL OPS: This is going to be an all night game. This is a 24-hour a day, seven day a week profession. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's about as smooth as it can get right there. TAYLOR: From the air, the agents pointed at Border Patrol and National Guard vehicles stationed in hotspots, something they say is new as of this week. With added resources, they say Border Patrol agents aren't stretched as thin and can do more of this. (END VIDEO TAPE) TAYLOR (on camera): And not only are the number of encounters down here in the El Paso sector, but also the number of got-aways. Border Patrol agents tell us on Wednesday, the day before our ride along, they had zero got- aways for the first time in years. Bret? BAIER: Brooke, thank you. The village of East Palestine, Ohio, and railroad company Norfolk Southern have settled all claims from the 2023 train derailment that spewed toxic chemicals into the air and ground. The most recent settlement provides $22 million to be used for priorities identified by the village. Vice President, former Ohio senator, J.D. Vance will travel to East Palestine on Monday to mark the second anniversary of that disaster. Up next, the push to take back control of the Panama Canal. We'll have reaction to President Trump's efforts to try to retake control of that vital waterway. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: President Trump is looking to make good on his promise to take back the Panama Canal, control of it. Secretary of State Marco Rubio set to make his first international trip there tomorrow. But Panama's president says they will not discuss control of the waterway. Correspondent Steve Harrigan reports tonight from Panama city. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) STEVE HARRIGAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: The Panama Canal is a 51-mile strip begun by the U.S. in 1903. It took 10 years to build, at the time the most expensive construction project ever. Gates or locks are opened like a water elevator. Ships are raised and pulled forward by trains. About 36 ships a day come through around the clock. It takes 10 hours, and the biggest ships pay more than $1 million in fees. The canal saves ships time and money. Instead of 27 days from New York to San Francisco going around south America, it takes just 11 days through the Panama Canal. The U.S. signed a treaty in 1977 gave the canal to Panama in 1999. For 25 years there was little controversy. Now, fears of Chinese influence over the canal have led to calls from the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers to reassert U.S. control over the canal, by force if necessary. Reaction here in Panama among many of the elites is shock. CARLOS ERNESTO GONZALEZ, PANAMANIAN BUSINESS EXECUTIVE: So for us this was a surprise. There is no conflict with the United States. And it's not clear why this is happening for us. HARRIGAN: A different reaction among some ordinary Panamanians who say they never see any of the billions the government earns from the canal. RAFAEL, ARTISAN (through translator): All the money from the canal goes to the politicians and the rich people. So if you ask me my opinion, will Panamanians fight to defend the canal? They will tell you the same answer I tell you, no. HARRIGAN: Rubio called Chinese influence at the canal a potential chokepoint. President Trump has gone several steps further, posting that China controls the canal. (END VIDEO TAPE) HARRIGAN (on camera): President Trump then added a threat in all capital letters, ""Panama will not get away with this."" Bret? BAIER: Steve Harrigan in Panama City. Steve, thanks. Monday, Rich Edson has an exclusive interview with Secretary Marco Rubio as he makes his first foreign trip as secretary of state. Tonight, a former senior adviser to the Federal Reserve has been arrested on charges he conspired to steal Fed trade secrets for the benefit of the People's Republic of China. Justice Department officials say John Harold Rogers allegedly shared confidential information with Chinese co- conspirators. He's charged with conspiracy to commit economic espionage. Back here at home, the final debate among eight candidates vying to chair the Democratic National Committee devolved into chaos today as a wave of leftwing protesters repeatedly interrupted that event. The demonstrators were eventually removed. Jamie Harrison, the DNA chairman for the past four years, declined to seek another term. Harrison told the Associated Press today",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 the panel on the politics and investigation into the air disaster over Washington. First, Beyond our Borders tonight, the tomb housing the remains of a polarizing far right French leader vandalized less than three weeks after he was buried. Jean Marie Le Pen was the founder of France's National Front Party. Police say they are stepping up security at the cemetery. An investigation is underway. And this is a live look at Japan, one of the big stories there tonight, Japanese police arrest a Canadian national on suspicion of smuggling more than 700 pounds of meth into Japan. Authorities say the drugs were hidden inside large industrial machinery that the suspect had shipped in a container from the United States. Just some of the other stories Beyond our Borders tonight. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Breaking tonight, we're getting some word out of northeast Philadelphia of what's believed to be a small plane crashing into a number of houses there. Waiting for some pictures there. I think we have them coming to us from FOX 29 in Philadelphia. Fires burning in multiple spots. If you know that area in northeast Philadelphia, Cottman Avenue and Roosevelt Boulevard. We're being told by FOX 29 that multiple fires are burning. There are pieces of what appears to be this airplane scattered here. That's from Steve Keeley, one of the reporters from FOX 29 on the ground. You can see some of the fires there. Authorities closing off those areas. We're trying to get word of casualties. We don't have any official word from authorities yet. But let's listen in to FOX 29 as they're reporting this live. It just happened a few minutes ago. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: -- breathing in this area. He smelled jet fuel here. Steve, are you there? STEVE KEELY, REPORTER: I'm in the middle of the smoke now, Jason. I was trying to go back to get a closer look at the car parts, and the smoke is blowing along the ground. And I see a foot off the gas where a truck just showed up because I'm told that a gas line is in danger. Sometimes meters that are on a house are connected to gas lines. And something might have hilt that. But I'm walking through the Roosevelt Mall parking lot right now, and I'm going to walk over, and now as I realize my previous path, the parts I saw scattered in the parking lot are very, very far from where I videotaped a bunch of fires. And so Roosevelt Mall is pretty big, an outdoor strip mall for those of you don't know. It goes down Roosevelt Boulevard all the way down Cottman Avenue. And this is packed. And now I'm hearing saws like dog saws right now in front of the Dunkin' Donuts, which tells you rescues are going on. And that's fire department activity trying to cut through something on Cottman Avenue. Now, Jason, now the planes are on a house. That's what they are doing. A house is on fire. The corner house. I don't know what side street it is. There is flames shooting up the roof of a house. That was the side street. The corner house at Cottman on the side street right in front of the Roosevelt Mall is on fire now. And I'm looking at flames 10 feet high out of the roof. And now I see firefighter ladders. Firefighters, that was what I was hearing, because the smoke shifted, and now I can see. So that's where more smoke is coming from. This was right where there was a bunch of cars on fire along Cottman. So a house is now on fire. And it's the top of the house. So if the flames started on the first floor from this plane crash, the flames have now gone up to at least two floors. I can't tell if that's a two or three floor house. But that is now the latest. And these flames are getting worse coming out of this house now, Jason. But there's a -- the fire department is right on the scene. They were right there, and I did not see a house on fire initially. So, there we go. It looks like the flames are down, or at least they are being blocked by smoke right now. But -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Steve, we're watching. We'll look at some of your video you took earlier. I'm having a hard time understanding what the in world happened, because you are describing a house on fire. I see a Dunkin' Donuts. I see cars on fire, a debris field that may be stretched several city blocks. And I'm trying to really understand what has happened here in northeast Philadelphia with just chaos happening in this parking lot. You have got the mall there, several fast food restaurants, a T-Mobile store, and a home. How many fires are we talking about here? KEELY: So, Jason, now I'm looking directly across. There is a fire on Cottman Avenue on my side which looks like an SUV or a truck. And it is all gone. But it's still on fire. So I don't know if that's fuel or whatever is burning. And then across Cottman Avenue, directly from where that vehicle is on fire is where that house is on fire. And those flames are shooting out of a second or third story roof right now. So, that's what is going on right there. This is one -- this is probably four blocks off of Cottman Avenue across the street. I'm looking at firefighters putting spotlights up there. The flames on the street level where that SUV or truck is on fire are a good 10 feet into the air as well. And the flames on the roof are a good 10 feet. And there is very thick smoke. The only positive news is that white smoke now, no longer black smoke. That smoke is coming directly at me. There is a light rain blowing here, too, as well. So rain is falling. There is the wind. And chaos, if you can put it, that's a perfect word for what is going on. Now it looks like firefighters are trying to douse that vehicle fire across the street as well. And these streets were blocked. When I was coming here, the police were trying to clear Roosevelt Boulevard. The fire vehicles were having trouble cutting through the rush hour traffic on the boulevard and getting to this scene. And so they kept the boulevard open as they were trying to clear the traffic off of it. Here comes some more thick smoke. I'm sorry. So, what you are hearing is everybody just trying to look out for my own good. All right, so, Jason now it's complete -- I can't even see right now. It's complete black. All I see is a flickering red light or so. And now I can see some more flames on the street. But this is still not under control by any stretch. And like I said, multiple fires. And then it wasn't just vehicles. There was at least one house on fire as well. I'm moving just to see, to get out of this smoke, number one, which will also help me breathe and see a little more. So -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And Steve, you mentioned when you first got there, you said you saw plane parts. KEELY: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can you tell what size plane by the parts you saw? KEELY: And these parts were not big. Like I said, I didn't know what they were. I was tripping over things. It's in a parking lot. And then this officer said, hey, these are parts of the airplane. And they began sweeping it off. And you will see some of that in my video as I'm walking through it. You don't want to walk into evidence scenes and debris scenes. And so I got out of there. But in the one video I sent back you will see that. And I had no idea what it was. It just -- it was -- it wasn't anything that you could identify. Let me put it that way. It didn't look like airplane parts. And the biggest part I saw was like two feet by two feet it. So it looked like insulation. It looked like something from a house. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It very well may have been. It looks like, as you mentioned, a house was on fire. Every firefighter in the area, I have got to imagine, is there along with a cop. And, you know, we have no word on any injuries or fatalities. We have no word on what kind of plane this was. And we showed a doorbell video, if you are just joining us, a doorbell video from a half-a-mile away, I'm assuming. KEELY: All right, Jason. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, go ahead. KEELY: So to give you an idea. (INAUDIBLE) KEELY: All right, so I'm with a worker right across from where the house is on fire. What did you see in here while you were working? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Man, I was just working. I was making a drink and then I just see a big old explosion of light just out of nowhere. I felt the vibrations. It was crazy, man. KEELY: And did you have any idea what it was? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Man, I don't know. At first I thought it was like a gas leak or a gas truck, you know what I'm saying, collided with a car. But then I hear it's a plane. And I'm like, what, what do you mean a plane? KEELY: And then you looked out the back door here, you are fairly close. You see a house on fire here. Do you know what street that is right there? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Cottman. KEELY: But the side street? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, the side? I'm not -- side street? KEELY: But you saw all the fires. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I saw all the fires, yes. It was crazy, man. KEELY: And what was the reaction of everybody in the cafe and all around here? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, man, everybody ran, bro. Everyone ran. Who wouldn't leave? KEELY: How did you finally hear about it being an airplane? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It was crazy, man. KEELY: You see all the parts in the parking lot next to the cafe here? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not the parts per se, but I can see fire. Smoke and everything. KEELY: All right, sir, thank you very much. Glad you're safe. So there you go, Jason. This worker is about a football field's length from where the house is on fire. So we're behind. And you are pulling up the map and you're wondering where I'm talking to you from, I'm right behind the Cane's chicken store which is front right on Cottman, and the front of the Roosevelt Mall, which is diagonal right across from this house on fire. So I don't see any more flames on the house. But I see flames initially on the street that have been right in the driveway of the Roosevelt Mall, right next to the store that lists the sign that lists all the stores here. Those flames are now picking up. And I have no idea what is burning. It must be some kind of fuel. And I don't know if that's the gameplan, because now I see a team of -- BAIER: OK, this is live in Philadelphia. This is our FOX affiliate, FOX 29. It appears it is a plane crash. But we haven't confirmed that yet. You are hearing the reporter Steve Keely on the ground with FOX 29. We're going to stay with these pictures and this breaking news out of northeast Philadelphia, very close to the northeast Philadelphia airport. You can see all of the fire trucks and the authorities on the ground. We are going to stay with this and figure out what is happening in Philadelphia. See you Monday on SPECIAL REPORT.

"Interview with Marco Rubio, U.S. Secretary of State",2025-02-26T00:00:00Z,"Ainsley Earharft, Brian Kilmeade, Steve Doocy","FOX AND FRIENDS 6:00 AM EST Marco Rubio Fox News, FOX AND FRIENDS6:00 AM EST, NEWS; International, 1136words",U.S. Federal; Florida,"BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Well, America's Secretary of State Marco Rubio has a lot to say about our adversaries and our allies as well. AINSLEY EARHARDT, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: But he also shares a more personal side with Brian in an interview at the State Department. KILMEADE: Yeah, it feels like just hours ago. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KILMEADE: So Mr. Secretary, where are we going? MARCO RUBIO, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: This is Jefferson's Room for Secretary of State. KILMEADE: I know it's been a blur. You got nominated. How surprised were you when you got the call from President Trump that this is the position he had in mind? Or did he tell you, Marco, I win, you're in? RUBIO: No, you know, we really never talked about it beforehand. He sort of called and said, I want to make you Secretary of State. You don't say no to that. It's an enormous honor to be able to do it. KILMEADE: Totally surprised? RUBIO: Pretty much, I mean, in the sense that, I thought maybe he'd think of me for something, I didn't know what role, you know. But I think what's most exciting to me is the time in which I get to do it. I get to work for a president who is committed to making big change. You know, at the end of the Cold War, we sort of lost our way and we have a chance to remake American foreign policy and put the national interest, like what's important to America, first and foremost. And people say America first. Yes, it's not America only, but it is America first. And bringing it back to that is something I'm excited to be a part of. KILMEADE: Having known you for a while, I've always used to know you as someone who calls his own shots. It's like, this is what I think, this is how I feel. Now, you're running the State Department, but you're also taking the marching orders from the president. How hard is it to work for somebody? RUBIO: Not hard at all. I mean, that's the way I work public works (ph). KILMEADE: You have no experience with that. RUBIO: No, no, but the Republic -- the Republic, that's how it works. The president was the one who got the electoral votes. The president is the president. He's the one -- nobody voted for me for Secretary of State except for the senators, right? KILMEADE: Right. RUBIO: The American people elected him. So, the president of the United States under our system of government -- KILMEADE: Right. RUBIO: -- sets foreign policy. That's the way the system works. And our job is to provide advice and counsel and -- but at the end of the day, he makes the decisions and our job is to execute. KILMEADE: Right. RUBIO: And people need to realize that. KILMEADE: So when people say, hey, Senator, when you were Senator, you felt this way. Now you're Secretary of State, you feel this way, your answer is? RUBIO: That they obviously don't understand the American Republic. KILMEADE: Right. I know you're anti-DEI administration and that's where the country's heading. But it's hard not to acknowledge that you're the highest-ranking Hispanic American in the history of the country and the first to hold this. What does that mean to you? RUBIO: Well, it means this is a great country because I don't think I'm Secretary of State because I'm Hispanic. I think I'm Secretary of State because it doesn't matter. People want good people in these positions, and that's the point. That's what's wrong with DEI. It divides us on the basis of our ethnicity, our race, our gender, whatever it may be. And in fact, what we should be is a meritocracy where we are rewarding people for competence and performance. KILMEADE: So do you know in history, the most smoothest running administrations have clashes? You have Jake Sullivan, according to reports, and Antony Blinken were not even speaking by the end of their four-year term. How do you avoid that? RUBIO: The president has put together a tremendous team of people that have known each other for a long time. First of all, half of us are from Florida, so that's good. KILMEADE: Right. RUBIO: I've known Mike Waltz since his entire time in Congress. We've been working together for a long time and we're aligned in our thinking. Steve Witkoff, who's an envoy. KILMEADE: Right. RUBIO: Steve lives in Miami. Great guy, phenomenal, very talented person, very smart. I talk to Steve four times a day. Talk about Pam Bondi, I've known her for 15 years. So it's just a team of people that all know each other, have been working together for a long time and get along, and it extends to the president. KILMEADE: But Mr. Secretary, I do remember, when you were running for president against him and how personal it got, and you guys were slugging it out. RUBIO: Yeah. KILMEADE: Do you ever talk about that? That, like, how rugged it got? RUBIO: Well, I'll never tell you -- KILMEADE: And how tight you are now? RUBIO: I'll never tell you what we talk about. I can only tell you he picked me to be his secretary of state. KILMEADE: Right. RUBIO: Like, I like watching boxing, grew up watching a lot of boxing. My dad was a boxing fan. I've never heard anyone at the end of a boxing match ask him, hey, why did you punch that guy in the face in the third round? KILMEADE: Right. RUBIO: You're in a competitive environment. What I can tell you is, the voters picked Donald Trump and I think they were wise to do so. KILMEADE: You are also a dad. RUBIO: Yeah. KILMEADE: And you're also a husband. Your son's playing over at the University of Florida, scored a touchdown, we see that. Is it going to be hard to keep in touch with your family with a job? RUBIO: Yeah. KILMEADE: You've already been to 12 different places. RUBIO: I mean, we have phones, you know, and we have the ability to communicate with them. My kids are a little older now, you know, they're a little -- they have their own lives going on, so they probably don't like to hear from me as much as they used to. And so, that -- look, that'll always be my most important job -- husband, father, and then secretary of state. And I don't think those things are in conflict. My family is -- I wouldn't be able to do this if they weren't supportive. KILMEADE: Congratulations again, Secretary. RUBIO: Thank you. (END VIDEOTAPE) STEVE DOOCY, FOX NEWS CO-HOST OF ""FOX & FRIENDS"": And they've got -- the family has got to be all on the same page because that's a job that does not end at six o'clock at night. KILMEADE: No. And I did ask him at two in the morning, if you got a call that China is invading Taiwan, what do you do? He says, we're going to be strong enough, so that doesn't happen. But that's the ambiguous -- ambiguity with that question. That is going to be the number one thing facing him. DOOCY: Well, you couldn't wake up Joe Biden at two o'clock. KILMEADE: Right. No, you couldn't. No, around 10, when they -- DOOCY: It was hard to wake him up at noon. KILMEADE: Right. So, they have a high pace.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Have a great night, everybody, and we'll see you back here on Monday. KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Evening, everybody. I'm Kevin Corke, standing in for Bret Baier tonight. President Trump, working to downsize the federal workforce and to increase energy output. We're going to take you to Houston for an exclusive look at Immigration and Customs Enforcement efforts to track down migrant criminals, a story you won't want to miss. And Republicans prepare to take on Washington's local government, as the president prepares to address crime and homelessness in the district. But first -- ""BREAKING TONIGHT"", Ukrainian president, Zelenskyy, says President Trump is the key to ending the war with Russia. Zelenskyy, meeting with Vice President J.D. Vance today at the Munich Security Conference, as the administration considers its policy for the future of Ukraine. The vice president said today, NATO membership for Kyiv is not off the table. That, despite Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and the president, saying, membership was not practical. Senior White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich is at the White House, a reports on how those comments have evolved. But we begin with Lucas Tomlinson. He is traveling with the defense secretary and reports tonight from Warsaw, Poland. Evening, Lucas. LUCAS TOMLINSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Kevin. Today in Europe, Vice President J.D. Vance had some very tough words for European allies as his defense -- as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, says he and Vance are on the same page, others are not so sure, but how to comes to ending Russia's war in Ukraine. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PETE HEGSETH, UNITED STATES DEFENSE SECRETARY: You don't have to operate under a position of trust in order to negotiate a deal. TOMLINSON (voice over): Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, alongside his Polish counterpart, says trust is not a prerequisite for peace talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. J.D. VANCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We had a number of fruitful conversations. TOMLINSON (voice over): Next door in Germany, Vice President J.D. Vance met with Ukraine's president, after telling European leaders he is concerned with something else. VANCE: The threat that I worry the most about vis-a-vis Europe, is not Russia, it's not China, it's not any other external actor. And what I worry about is the threat from within. The retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values. TOMLINSON (voice over): Vance downplayed Russian meddling in foreign elections using social media. TOMLINSON: If your democracy can be destroyed with a few $100,000 of digital advertising from a foreign country, then, it wasn't very strong to begin with. TOMLINSON (voice over): Vance, also accused the European Union Commission of being, ""commissars"", a reference to Soviet communists. Some Europeans felt insulted. BORIS PISTORIUS, GERMAN DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator): If I understood him correctly, he compared conditions in parts of Europe with those in authoritarian regimes. Ladies and gentlemen, that is not acceptable. TOMLINSON (voice over): Vance told The Wall Street Journal, ""Everything is on the table,"" including future NATO membership for Ukraine, the opposite of what Hegseth said at NATO headquarters two days prior. HEGSETH: The reality of Ukraine membership in NATO as a part of a negotiated settlement, unlikely. And I stand by the comments that I made on that first day in the Ukraine contact group. There is no daylight between myself and the vice president. (END VIDEOTAPE) TOMLINSON (on camera): Tomorrow, Hegseth would visit with more deployed American troops here in Poland, before flying home to welcome the DOGE team at the Pentagon. Kevin? CORKE: Lucas, in Warsaw for us tonight. Lucas, thank you so much. President Trump is in Palm Beach, Florida tonight, after addressing questions over a possible shift in policy for Ukraine from the Oval Office today. Senior White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich was there and asked the president about the back and forth. Evening, Jacqui. JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Kevin. Ukraine wants clear answers on how the U.S. will shield it from future Russian aggression, and it's thrown a wrench into a deal that would continue U.S. military support in exchange for access to Ukraine's rare earth minerals, both Vice President Vance and Treasury Secretary Bessent left talks empty handed. Now, President Trump may need to work the phones. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. President -- HEINRICH (voice over): It was news to President Trump that Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker was puzzled and disturbed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, nixing the prospect of Ukraine NATO membership at his Brussels speech. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I haven't heard that. I mean, Roger is a very good friend of mine, and Pete is obviously, he is been doing a great job. I haven't heard -- UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (INAUDIBLE). TRUMP: Let me -- let me -- look -- HEINRICH (voice over): Wicker muscled Hegseth's confirmation through the Senate, but said today at the Munich Security Conference, ""He made a rookie mistake. Everybody knows, and people in the administration know you don't say before your first meeting what you will agree to and what you won't agree to."" The president, asked if he knew what Hegseth would say. TRUMP: Generally speaking, yes. Generally speaking, I was. I'll speak to Roger. I'll speak to Pete. I'll find out. HEINRICH (voice over): Vice President Vance, reestablishing some leverage today, clarifying nothing is off the table, including sanctions and U.S. military involvement if Putin won't take a deal. Back home, 75,000 federal workers took the buyout deal, short of the five to 10 percent of the workforce targeted. But Trump, says mass layoffs to make up for it are not the next step. TRUMP: That's 75,000 more than we would have had. And nobody knows what that final number is, because in the end, I think a lot of people are not going to show up to work. HEINRICH: While the White House works to downsize government, it's super sizing energy output, starting with the new LNG project in Louisiana, new exports for Asia and Europe, and an executive order undoing the 600 million offshore acres, former President Biden shielded. The president now heading to Mar-a-Lago, where he'll monitor tomorrow's hostage releases in Gaza. TRUMP: I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow at 12:00. It was up to me and take a very hard stance. I actually think they should release all of the hostages. (END VIDEOTAPE) HEINRICH (on camera): The president also revealed tonight, Indian Prime Minister Modi didn't make any offers to cut his country's tariffs in their meeting yesterday. However, the president said Modi wasn't thrilled about his reciprocal tariffs and some more action, whatever that is, is planned in two weeks from now. President Trump, also said that he thinks plans from BRICS countries to try to undermine the U.S. dollar are, ""breaking up rapidly"" in the face of his 100 percent tariff threat. Kevin. CORKE: Jacqui Heinrich, at the White House. Jacqui, thank you. HEINRICH: Thanks. CORKE: A federal prosecutor has agreed to file a motion to dismiss a corruption case against Democratic New York City Mayor Eric Adams at the discretion of President Trump's justice department. This comes as he appears to be working closely with the White House to address immigration and public safety. Mayor Adams claims he did not cut a deal to end his case. Correspondent Alexis McAdams, takes a closer look at his immigration initiatives and his relationship with the Trump administration. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALEXIS MCADAMS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): A new duo teaming up to get migrant criminals off the streets of New York City. ERIC ADAMS (D), MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY: We need to go after these dangerous people in our street. And now, I have someone that understands that narrative, and we are fighting together to get it done. MCADAMS (voice over): Border czar Tom Homan has previously slammed Mayor Eric Adams, but now, they appear to be on the same page. TOM HOMAN, FORMER ACTING DIRECTOR, IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT: I've called the mayor out many times for not stepping up when it comes to public safety threats. But I tell you, when I sat down with him, I saw the cop in him, and he really does want to do the right thing. MCADAMS (voice over): The new partnership in the wake of the justice department attorneys quitting, after they say they were told to drop the federal corruption case against Mayor Adams. The mayor, releasing a statement today, saying, in part, ""I want to be crystal clear with New Yorkers. I never offered, nor did anyone offer on my behalf, any trade of my authority as your mayor for an end to my case. Never."" Earlier, the justice department said in a statement, the move to dismiss the charges was in keeping with its core function of prosecuting dangerous criminals. This week, Adams meeting with top immigration leaders and pushing to loosen sanctuary laws that he says are flawed. Even letting ICE agents back into New York City's Rikers Island jail for the first time since 2014. So, the feds can locate illegal migrants who police say are convicted criminals, and get intel on members of the Venezuelan gang, Tren de Aragua. HOMAN: Getting back to Rikers Island is a game changer? (END VIDEOTAPE) MCADAMS (on camera): So, this new partnership comes as the city is closing dozens of migrant shelters all across New York, and also those relief centers, because they are trying to cut back on the spending, because they have already spent billions of dollars on the migrant crisis. We'll keep an eye on it. Kevin. CORKE: Alexis McAdams. Alexis, thank you so much. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests have increased significantly under the Trump administration. And tonight, we have a Fox News exclusive to share with you, some of those operations are fascinating. You want to see this. This is correspondent Brooke Taylor's opportunity. She was embedded with officers in Houston, and she shows us how ICE works to target some of the most dangerous criminals. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're conducting an investigation. MANUEL RIVERA-PERDOMO, ILLEGAL MIGRANT FROM EL SALVADOR: Investigation? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. RIVERA-PERDOMO: For what? BROOKE TAYLOR, FOX NEWS CHANNEL NATIONAL NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice over): An illegal migrant from El Salvador, wanted for a child sex assault conviction in his home country, is back in ICE custody. He is already been deported twice. RIVERA-PERDOMO: Let me see the order or something, because I don't know -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Get in the vehicle. BRET BRADFORD, DIRECTOR, ICE ENFORCEMENT AND REMOVAL OPERATIONS HOUSTON: We're not looking to go out there and scare or terrorize the communities. We're looking to make these communities safer. These folks, criminals like this individual here, they are victimizing those same communities. Nobody wants those folks in our communities. TAYLOR: The director of in Houston, says their arrest numbers have nearly tripled in the last few weeks. He tells Fox they're also working closer than ever with other federal agencies like HSI, the FBI, CBP, and ATF. The same week as Fox's exclusive ride along, officials arrested three suspected Tren de Aragua members in Houston. BRADFORD: We really do try and target the worst of the worst. So, we're really looking at our public safety threats or national security threats. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Targets coming out the house. TAYLOR: According to ICE, this illegal migrant from Mexico, convicted of alien smuggling, was deported in 2005, but managed to slip back into the U.S. D.H.S. data obtained by Fox News Digital, reveals there have been more than 11,700 ICE arrests across the country since January 20th, that is a 137 percent increase compared to the same time last year. BRADFORD: It's nice sometimes to stop and reflect on what have you prevented? How many people have you kept from being victimized, because we've taken these folks up, not only off the streets, but out of the country? (END VIDEOTAPE) TAYLOR: And DHS numbers reveal that since inauguration, ICE has arrested 430 illegal migrants labeled as gang members. That's including Tren de Aragua. Compare that number to just 210 during the same time frame last year. So, a massive increase there. Kevin. CORKE: Great job out there, Brooke. Thank you so much. Investors are closely watching President Trump's plans to implement tariffs and negotiations to end the war in Ukraine. Stocks mixed today. The Dow dropping 165. S&P 500 fell less than a half of a point. NASDAQ up 81. For the week, stocks were actually up. Dow gaining a half a percent. S&P 500 up 1-1/2. NASDAQ gained almost 2-2/3. Bret Baier takes over after this quick time out here on SPECIAL REPORT. Coming up next, Republicans considering dueling budget plans in both the House and the Senate. We'll tell you about that. But first, ""BEYOND THEIR BORDERS"" tonight. Hamas names three Israeli hostages. They'll be released over the weekend in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian protesters. Among the group is an Israeli-American dual citizen whose wife was pregnant when he was captured. You'll get to meet his daughter for the very first time upon his return. It's the sixth swap since the cease fire began. 21 Israeli hostages freed in exchange for more than 700 Palestinian prisoners. The Vatican tonight, says Pope Francis is being treated for a respiratory infection, after a week-long bout with bronchitis. He was taken to the hospital earlier today to undergo tests, showing a mild fever. And this is a live look at Australia, one of the big stories there tonight, Australian and Philippine authorities helping to prevent Valentine's Day scams. They are warning folks of suspects who use online dating apps to develop whirlwind romances with victims, and they eventually convinced them to invest in cryptocurrency before, you know, shifting the payments to a separate account. Officials say victims lost around $15 million to online love scams, just last year. Just some of the other stories ""BEYOND OUR BORDERS"" tonight on SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Welcome back. My thanks to Kevin Corke for taking over the top of the show. Now to the other news, Philadelphia police are investigating after two people were shot during the Eagle's Super Bowl parade. Officials say the two women were outside the parade footprint when the gunfire broke out, they were taken to the hospital. Last year, one person was killed and 21 others injured in a shooting at a Super Bowl parade for the Kansas City Chiefs. TikTok is back online in Apple and Google App Stores after President Trump delayed the enforcement of a ban on the social media platform. The app was initially removed one month ago after a law required Chinese firm ByteDance to divest it or have it banned in the U.S. President Trump delayed the enforcement of that law until April 5th. Investigators looking into last month's midair crash at Washington National Reagan -- Reagan National Airport say the army helicopter may not have heard the direction to fly behind the American Airlines jet as it landed. The National Transportation Safety Board says the cockpit recording shows the transmission was interrupted because the helicopter's microphone key was pressed at the same time. The pilots were unable to hear the words passed behind. Officials say it will take more than a year to finalize the report into the collision that left 67 people dead. President Trump has most of his cabinet in place, with a few key nominees expected to be confirmed next week. It comes as Republicans consider whether a Senate or a House budget proposal will better help deliver the President's agenda. Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram reports from Capitol Hill. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That concludes today's business of the House Budget Committee. CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): House Republicans crafting a budget blueprint which slashes $4.5 trillion in taxes, but the tax cuts are conditional. REP. CHIP ROY (R-TX): What we did, though, was tie it to, importantly, finding the cuts necessary to reduce the government spending that's perpetuating the inflation tax on Americans. PERGRAM (voice over): This satisfies conservatives, but moderates worry about extra spending for the border and the military. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: 4.5 trillion does not leave a lot of room to do the president's priorities. PERGRAM (voice over): The Budget Committee is just the first step. PERGRAM: Can you characterize how tough it is to get something through committee, but then moving at the floor? That's a completely different angle. REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): It is. Yes, we got work to do, as we always -- as we always do, in any measure that's this consequential, because we have very diverse conference, and we need to get everybody on board. PERGRAM (voice over): Both Republican leaders in Congress focused on who can vote for what. SEN. JOHN THUNE (R-SD): The numbers you have to pay attention to are 218 and 51 because it's 218 to pass anything in the House and 51 to get anything through the Senate. PERGRAM (voice over): On nominees, President Trump and Thune are pitching a perfect game so far, 16 nominees up, 16 nominees confirmed, but bruising battles loom. FBI Director Nominee Kash Patel gets a likely floor vote next week. All Democrats oppose him, but Republicans could break with the president on Labor Secretary Nominee Lori Chavez- DeRemer. GOP Kentucky Senator Rand Paul questions her support for expanding rights of workers to organize. (END VIDEOTAPE) PERGRAM (on camera): Chavez- DeRemer's confirmation hearing comes next week. President Trump believes the nomination boosts his support with unions. Democrats could confirm her if the GOP balks. Bret. BAIER: Chad Pergram live on the Hill. Chad, thanks. A federal district court judge has extended a freeze on the Department of Government Efficiency's effort to access more than $5 trillion in Treasury Department payments. Arguments were heard today on that order. Correspondent Bryan Llenas is following that. He's at the federal courthouse in Manhattan, Bryan. BRYAN LLENAS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Bret, good evening. A New York Federal judge says she'll decide at a later date, whether or not to issue a preliminary injunction to continue to block Elon Musk and DOGE from directly accessing the vital U.S. Treasury Department's central payment system. This system is where 90 percent of the U.S. government spending, that's $5 trillion a year is processed. This is how most money is dispersed to federal agencies, including Social Security payments, veteran's benefits, tax refunds and Medicaid. This payment database also contains Americans' most sensitive financial information, like Social Security numbers, routing numbers and addresses. Today in court, lawyers representing 19 state attorneys general argued politically appointed DOGE employees are not authorized to access Americans' financial data, saying it violates Americans privacy and leaves them susceptible to hackers. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LETITIA JAMES, NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL: No one elected Elon Musk and his minions, and no one has allowed him to have access to this information. WILLIAM TONG, CONNECTICUT ATTORNEY GENERAL: This is the largest data breach in American history. That's what this is. LLENAS (voice over): Now, direct access to this payment system allows Musk and DOGE to quickly stop or redirect federal funds and conduct independent audits. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi blasted the lawsuit against DOGE. PAM BONDI, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: The president, of course, is going to prevail. He's looking out for our tax dollars, and it's absurd that that's their best argument, we're worried about hackers. (END VIDEO CLIP) LLENAS (on camera): According to a Government Accountability Office report, the U.S. government loses an estimated at most $521 billion a year to fraud, Bret. BAIER: Bryan Llenas outside the federal courthouse in Manhattan. Bryan, thank you. Up next, we head underground for a look at an age old process that Elon Musk wants to modernize. We'll bring you there. Plus, amid changes at the federal level, Republicans prepare to shake up Washington, D.C.'s local government. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: As President Trump's federal actions play out in court, the administration and congressional Republicans are turning their focus to Washington's local government. Some members of Congress want to return control of the district to Congress. Correspondent Mark Meredith tells us how local officials are reacting to the possible changes. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MURIEL BOWSER, WASHINGTON D.C. MAYOR: We neither have a voice or a vote. MARK MEREDITH, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Washington D.C.'s Mayor Democrat Muriel Bowser is fighting to keep the nation's capital under her and the city council's control as congressional Republicans introduced legislation removing home rule, the ability of Washingtonians to choose their leaders. SEN. MIKE LEE (R-UT): Washington, D.C. in short, belongs to all Americans. MEREDITH (voice over): Utah Senator Mike Lee is co-sponsoring the BOWSER Act, or Bringing Oversight to Washington and Safety to Every Resident. Critics say increases in carjackings and shootings prove D.C. leaders have lost control. So far this year, homicides in the district are up 21 percent. However, violent crime overall is down 31 percent. The bill sponsors right problems persist. ""The corruption, crime and incompetence of the D.C. government has been an embarrassment to our nation's capital for decades. President Trump has been a vocal critic of D.C.'s government. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Our nation's capital is the murder capital of the world. Our nation's capital is falling apart. MEREDITH (voice over): Fox is told soon, Trump will issue executive orders aimed at enhancing D.C.'s public safety and clearing away homeless encampments. Bowser says she has spoken with the White House about the effort but has an even bigger goal. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR MURIEL BOWSER, (D) WASHINGTON D.C.: What we should be focused on is our pathway to becoming the 51st state. (END VIDEO CLIP) MEREDITH: In 2021, House Democrats passed a bill to make that happen. But the measure stalled in the Senate, where Republicans called it a leftwing power grab. (END VIDEO TAPE) MEREDITH (on camera): Democrats have spent years pushing for D.C. statehood and Republicans have tried to kill the home rule act. Back in the 1990s, D.C. was going through a surge in crime. Republicans tried remove the measure, but, Bret, they came up short then. Bret? BAIER: All right, Mark, thank you. Now to a story we planned to bring you last night. When federal employees retire they submit physical paper copies of their applications to retire. Those are then transported to and underground mine where staff members sort and verify benefits by hand. You heard this from Elon Musk in the Oval Office. Well, the process has not aged well, and Elon Musk is bringing renewed attention to the unusual operation. Correspondent Nay Foy takes a look at home the Trump administration plans to modernize the records. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) ELON MUSK, CEO, TWITTER: It started in 1955. It looks like a time warp. NATE FOY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: About an hour drive north of Pittsburgh in western Pennsylvania, this the former limestone mine is at the center of the federal employee retirement process. Armed checkpoints and biometric access protect the facility and those who work here, 220 feet underground. They process retirement claims by hand, often searching for paper records across 330,000 square foot data center. MUSK: And the elevator breaks down sometimes, and then nobody can retire. FOY: The Department of Government Efficiency posted on X, quote, ""700 plus mine workers operate 230 feet underground to process 10,000 applications per month which are stored in manila envelopes and cardboard boxes. The Office of Personnel Management says it processed even fewer than that last year, averaging 7,381 claims per month. The agency tells FOX News, quote, ""OPM is evaluating methods to enhance the efficiency of retirement application processing. Iron Mountain, the company that leases the space to the U.S. government works with several high security clients White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said President Donald Trump promises to shut down the current retirement system. KAROLINE LEAVITT, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The president and Elon are shing a light on the truth about our federal government. FOY: A truth that may take a toll on this community. JOSH BOYERS, PENNSYLVANIA RESIDENT: There is not a lot of jobs in this area. Now that jobs are at risk over a flawed system that they go into every day that their government hasn't made changes to over the years. (END VIDEO TAPE) FOY (on camera): The Office of Personnel Management received an $18 million investment back in December to modernize the federal retirement process. But it has been tried before from 1980s. Until 2008, the United States invested more than $100 million to digitize the process, but the plan was scrapped each time because it was too complex. Bret? BAIER: Amazing. Nate, thank you. Up next, the panel on President Trump's latest round of executive orders and the federal court cases targeting DOGE. First, here's what some of our FOX affiliates around the country are covering tonight. FOX 11 in Los Angeles. California residents assess the damage from recent downpours and flooding in areas impacted by wildfires. While the rain has stopped, residents still face the threat of rock and mudslides in some areas. FOX 48 in Burlington, Vermont, as a New England bakery owner says he was offended by his town of Conway's effort to remove a painting displayed outside his shop. Sean Young testified in court today saying the New Hampshire town violated his First Amendment rights. Conway officials say the 90 square foot sign is four times bigger than local sign code allows. And this is a live look at Detroit from FOX 2. One of the big stories there tonight, a Michigan judge hopes shoplifter also clean up their act. He began issuing punishments for Walmart shoplifters to wash cars in the parking lot of a store north of Detroit this week. He believes 75 to 100 people will be sentenced to clean at weekend events in March and April. Just some of the other stories beyond our borders, and that's live outside our beltway, from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So this first executive order, it prohibits federal funding for COVID-19 mandates, vaccine mandates in schools. DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: OK. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Here is an executive order establishing the National Energy Dominance Council. TRUMP: Good, thank you. SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN, (D-MD): We have seen so many temporary restraining orders issued. That's a reflection of the scope of illegal activity going on by the Trump administration that thinks that it can use executive orders to make sweeping changes. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Well, and actually President Obama said he would use a pen and phone to make executive orders and sweeping changes if Congress didn't act. However, there are charges that are acting. As you look at headlines, ""Judge blocks Trump's gender affirming care executive orders nationwide."" ""Fourth federal judge blocks Trump's birthright citizenship executive order."" ""Judge tells agencies to restore webpages and data removed after Trump's executive order."" And in fact, if you look at a map, there are 19 states that have filed suit to stop DOGE access to those treasury Department files. Let's bring in our panel, Amy Walter, publisher and editor in chief of the ""Cook Political Report,"" Trey Gowdy, former Congressman from South Carolina, and Meredith McGraw, ""Politico"" national political correspondent. Trey, I want to start with you on these judge actions about these individual executive orders. Obviously, they will make their way, or I should say, obviously, but I expect them to make their way of appeal and then all the way to the Supreme Court, eventually. TREY GOWDY, FORMER SOUTH CAROLINA REPRESENTATIVE: Yes, some of them will. Birthright citizenship probably likely is. But TRO doesn't mean that you've lost. It just means the judge says for now I need more time to study the merits of the case. It doesn't mean you are going to lose. I mean, we just saw last week a judge reverse himself on an executive order. Every -- you mentioned President Obama. Joe Biden said what I'm doing is probably unconstitutional but I'm going to do it anyway. Executives test their own powers. And it's either up to the legislative or judicial branches to stop them. The legislature is not going to do it. Democrats have nowhere to go except to court. BAIER: We have seen and heard a lot of outrage from Democrats, lawmakers, and activists. Here is some of it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They are picking us off one by one. Yesterday it was one agency, the day before it was another agency. You know DOGE is hopping from agency to agency like it's the plague. REP. JAKE AUCHINCLOSS, (D-MA): The federal government, it's not Twitter, right? You can't move fast and break things and all that ends up getting scrambled is software code. This is real people's lives. REP. CHIP ROY, (R-TX): They protest too much. Elon is the guy that's out there exposing all of the fraud that we have all been watching unfold. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: It's waste, fraud, and abuse, Amy. And I'm wondering how that plays politically across the country. AMY WALTER, NATIONAL EDITOR, ""COOK POLITICAL REPORT"": Right. I think this is going to be fascinating to watch over these next few months because today you could make the argument that voters actually like what they are seeing. They feel like this is what the president campaigned on, and nobody is going to want to defend something called waste, fraud, and abuse. At the same time, what we're hearing not just from Democrats but from Republican members whose districts impacted by these cuts, whether it is a freeze on hiring and, say, the state parks, if that's in your district, or on some of the USAID funding where these farmers are sitting with a lot of grain that they were hoping to ship to these countries, and of course, the NIH freezes that are impacting research facilities. So right now, you all are right, the legislature has left it in the hands of the president. Whether that's going to continue, especially if constituents of these Republican members, not just Democrats, but Republican members start to come forward and start to express their dismay. BAIER: Meredith, Kimberley Strassel in ""The Wall Street Journal"" writes ""The GOP's DOGE test. What everyone knows even if most won't say is that the waste, fraud, and abuse that DOGE is tackling is gravy. The easy first targets are the woke, the indefensible. What everyone also knows, even if most won't say, is that this isn't where the real money is, meaning DOGE won't succeed without congressional GOP grit, a reality Republicans are studiously ignoring."" Interesting, and you wonder how that's going to play out on Capitol Hill considering what Amy just said. MEREDITH MCGRAW, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, ""POLITICO"": Right. We have seen how Republicans have praised some of the cost cutting measures that Elon Musk and his team has made, but at a certain point, some of those cost cutting measures that they are making is going to run up with people's constituencies at home, whether that's the programs that people get from the federal government or it's federal employment and real wages and jobs from people. BAIER: Meantime, Trey, there is an effort, an effort from New York City Mayor Eric Adams to work with Tom Homan, the border czar, in New York. This comes as the Department of Justice prosecutors just announced that those charges against Eric Adams are not moving forward. Here is Adams and Homan this morning on FOX. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR ERIC ADAMS, (D) NEW YORK CITY: There is real collaboration with HYDA (ph), our criminal justice apparatus on the city, state, and federal level. We want ICE to come and be a part of that meeting as well. TOM HOMAN, WHITE HOUSE BORDE",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 I will be back in New York City. And we won't be sitting on a couch. I will be in his office up his butt saying where in the hell is the agreement we came to? (LAUGHTER) ADAMS: And I want ICE to -- we are going to do them for the safety of the people of this city. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: It seems like they are working together but what about this announcement that the charges are officially going to be dropped? GOWDY: Yes, I mean, there are a lot of reasons the prosecutors drop charges. Evidentiary problems is the number one issue, but cooperation is another reason. Sometimes prosecutors cut a deal with someone because they are going to get something better. I don't know Danielle Sassoon. She is the interim U.S. attorney. She resigned in protest. I know this. Cooperation, this is not the first time charges have been dropped on somebody for cooperating. And Eric Adams was pretty friendly towards immigration enforcement before Donald Trump was ever elected. So if there is a quid pro quo, it goes back two years ago because that's when Eric Adams started talking tough on immigration. BAIER: Yes. And Mayor Adams is definitive that there is not this quid pro quo. Meantime, Amy, Sean Hannity talking to President Trump Elon Musk about the effort to divide the two. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: They want a divorce. They want you two to start hating each other, and they try -- oh, President Elon Musk, for example. You do know that they are doing that to you? TRUMP: Oh, I see it all the time. They tried it and then they stopped. But they have many different things of hatred. Actually, Elon called me. He said, you know they are trying to drive us apart. I said absolutely. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: That whole interview are will air Tuesday on Sean's show. But Amy, it's an interesting relationship, and you wonder where it will go. And clearly they are being -- trying to drive them apart, other people are. WALTER: And Democrats see in Elon Musk a much friendlier target. In other words, Elon Musk's overall favorable rating is a lot lower than that of President Trump right now. And so that's why you are seeing so many Democrats in their fire at Musk, making the argument that he wasn't elected. Donald Trump was. Who is this guy? And going to a conflict of interest argument that this isn't just somebody who was brought in from the outside who doesn't have a stake in the outcome of many decisions he's intimately involved in. For right now I don't think there is that wedge that is going to work to divide them. But at some point, if things do get very dicey, if we start to see it impacting opinions about the president or individual members of Congress, those up for reelection are starting to feel the heat, let's see where this relationship goes. BAIER: Right. All right, panel, stand by. Up next the Friday Lightning Round with Winners and Losers. And then, of course it is Friday," """"Notable Quotables."""" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. J.D. VANCE", (R) VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: While the Trump administration is very concerned with European security and believes that we can come to a reasonable settlement between Russia and Ukraine, and we also believe that it's important in the coming years for Europe to step up in a big way to provide for its own defense, what I worry about is the threat from within, the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Vice President J.D. Vance at the Munich Security Conference getting a lot of reaction to that speech from the Germans, from other leaders. He said there is an effort in Europe to squelch free speech, went into detail about that. When it comes to Ukraine and this possible settlement, President Zelenskyy of Ukraine talking with NBC, said this," """"Probably it will be very", very, very difficult, and, of course, in all the difficult situations, you have a chance. But we will have a low chance," low chance to survive without support of the United States. I think it's very important and critical."""" Deals about rare earth minerals and all that has been talked about have not come to fruition yet as far as signed", sealed, and delivered, as these negotiations continue. We're back your panel. Meredith, it seems like the president is confident he can get a deal. But the devil is in the details. MCGRAW: The devil is in the details. And there seemed to be a little bit of a conflict between what Vice President Vance said and what Defense Secretary Hegseth said," although they did try to clear some of that up. But Vance in his interview with """"The Wall Street Journal"""" really said that everything is on the table. And even though we didn't really see any breakthroughs from the meeting with Vance and Zelenskyy today", it did seem like there were some criteria that came out of this conference, including Zelenskyy saying that he is not going to meet with Putin face-to-face until some more details of any sort of deal with Putin and Trump are hammered out here. BAIER: And Trey, I mean, if it comes together, and it's a big if, because you have a lot of big things to figure out, it would be a major, major change. GOWDY: It's also something he said he would do -- I think he said he would do it in 24 hours. I'm guessing he was being hyperbolic when he said that. I would caution your viewers to pay less attention to what Secretary Hegseth and J.D. Vance say and attention to what Donald Trump says to Marco Rubio, John Ratcliffe, and Steve Witkoff, because that's going to be who negotiates between Russia and Ukraine. I cannot square up what Secretary Hegseth and J.D. Vance said. I find the two to be incongruent. But I don't think that is who is going to be negotiating this settlement. It'll be Rubio, Ratcliffe, and Witkoff. BAIER: So speaking of negotiations, Capitol Hill in the midst of figuring out a budget resolution, House Republicans got through one. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. CHIP ROY, (R-TX): We moved the budget through the Budget Committee last night. We actually have an upward ratchet so that number on the tax cuts can go higher. REP. PAT FALLON, (R-TX) HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE: We need to reduce the debt to GDP ratio. This budget would be one step towards our goal, but certainly we are still far away from it. SEN. JOHN THUNE, (R-SD) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: We are going to link up with the House and get something to the president that he can eventually sign into law. REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES, (D-NY) HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: They want to try to jam this budget down the throats of the American people in a partisan way. It's not something that Democrats, of course, would ever be expected to support. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: It seems like we are a long way from figuring how this is going to go as we approach another budget cliff, Amy. WALTER: Yes. And this is the way these reconciliation bills usually go. There's a lot of drama. There's a lot of noise. And then, you know, it drags out a little bit, and at the end of the day, again, typically, even with narrow margins -- obviously, this is the narrowest margin we have seen in our lifetime, but even a party with very narrow margins finds a way to get something over the finish line. I think if you are a member of the House or Senate right now, you are a Republican, you know this is your only real chance this year to get any meaningful legislation done. So, cutting those deals, whatever they may be, is going to be critically important. BAIER: All right, Winners and Losers. Trey, winner first, then loser. GOWDY: Joyce Edwards, the best freshman basketball player in America happens to be a University of South Carolina Gamecock. The loser, unfortunately, Bret, is me because I had forgotten it was Valentine's Day until you mentioned it off air. And Dollar Tree closes at 7:00 in my hometown. BAIER: You better hurry up. GOWDY: So it will be very chilly at my house tonight. (LAUGHTER) BAIER: Meredith, winner and loser? MCGRAW: Monty, the schnauzer that won the Westminster Dog Show, congrats to that cute dog. And losers, chocolate prices have gone up. The journal reported that cocoa commodities have really been on the rise. So your Valentine's Day candy that you get might be a little more expensive this year. BAIER: Yes, a little pricy. All right, lightning, winner and loser, Amy. WALTER: Well, maybe can I put my winner and loser in the same category. BAIER: OK. WALTER: The guy who was out kayaking -- BAIER: Oh, yes. WALTER: The guy who was out kayaking was captured and swallowed by a whale only to be spit back out. So, losing in that you are in the wrong place at the right time, but winning, you survived. (LAUGHTER) WALTER: So there we go. BAIER: That is good. I like that one the best. All right, guys, thanks so much. All right," that sound means it's Friday. Time for """"Notable Quotables."""" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: President Trump will not allow anyone to turn Uncle Sam into Uncle Sucker.

CHUCK SCHUMER, (D-NY) SENATE MINORITY LEADER: If the Senate held a secret ballot today, I'll bet Mr. Kennedy would never come close to being confirmed. ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR., HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY: What we're going to is give people good science. TULSI GABBARD," NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE DIRECTOR NOMINEE: To have a president who recognizes the cost of that sacrifice. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You can't spell """"felon"""" without """"Elon."""" UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't he's like a happy person. MUSK: They don't have a categorization code. It's like just a massive number of blank checks.

DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: I have to go with Kansas City. At the same time, Philadelphia has a fantastic -- UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Go to commercial. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The gravy train for a lot of these folks has been on biscuits wheels, and it's about to run off the dadgum tracks. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do any of these reporters make a case for $2.5 million for cow flatulence reduction? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Go to mouse cow, you mustard moo-moo.

Great show. Sorry. That's it for us. Have a great night. BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: You guys need costumes. Jesse, thanks. Good evening. I'm Bret Baier. Elon Musk brings his budget cutting shears to the Pentagon. The Trump administration takes a hard look at some of its predecessor spending on illegal immigrants and trying to take back billions of dollars allocated for climate change programs. But first, breaking tonight, we're just a few hours away from negotiations between senior U.S. and Russian officials aimed at improving ties and trying to find an end to the war in Ukraine. The talks are scheduled to begin in Saudi Arabia, but some of America's allies in Europe fear they may be excluded from the negotiations and are worried about the final deal, calling an emergency meeting to talk about it. Senior White House Correspondent Peter Doocy starts us off live from the North Lawn tonight. Good evening, Peter. PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. We understand that, today, President Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron spoke on the phone at least twice, and we are told that Macron plans to visit the United States in coming days. In the meantime, President Trump has assured Macron that he and Putin plan to make a deal as the peace process begins in Saudi Arabia with Crown Prince MBS playing peacemaker. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have a lot of things to talk about. DOOCY (voice over): American negotiators arrived in Saudi Arabia ahead of the Russians. Ukrainians say, they're not involved. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): We cannot recognize any agreement about us made without us. DOOCY (voice over): NATO Secretary General, still believes this is the way forward and does not think U.S. negotiators will appease Putin. MARK RUTTE, NATO SECRETARY GENERAL: Absolutely rejected criticism of President Trump's initiative, I think it's only right that he tries to end this war, and we need American leadership here. DOOCY (voice over): General Rutte spoke after sitting in on emergency talks in Paris with diplomats from European Union partners. METTE FREDERIKSEN, DANISH PRIME MINISTER: Russia is not only a threat against Ukraine or all of us. It maybe sounds a bit strange, but a cease fire is not -- it's not automatically peace, and it's not automatically long lasting peace. DOOCY (voice over): Secretary of State Rubio is looking to avoid a repeat Russian invasion of Ukraine after Trump's term. MARCO RUBIO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Vladimir Putin expressed his interest in peace, and the president expressed his desire to see an end to this conflict in a way that was enduring and that protected Ukrainian sovereignty, and that was an enduring peace, not that we're going to have another invasion in three or four years. DOOCY (voice over): Ukrainian rare earth minerals are on the White House's wish list in a peace deal. MIKE WALTZ, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: The American people deserve to be recouped. Deserve to have some type of payback for the billions that they have invested in this war. DOOCY (voice over): Democrats could support that if it's possible. SEN. JEAN SHAHEEN (D-NH): It's not at all clear who has possession of those critical minerals. Some of them are in the eastern part of Ukraine, where Russia controls the territory. Some of them are owned by private, actually, oligarchs. DOOCY (voice over): Rubio, Waltz and Witkoff are setting the table for a Saudi summit with Trump and Putin. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It could be very soon. It will be soon. (END VIDEOTAPE) DOOCY (on camera): It will be then President Trump's first 100 days back in office, if he and his team of negotiators are able to stick to their self- imposed deadline of a peace deal in Ukraine by late April, Bret. BAIER: Peter, how much did the U.S. delegation talk about the Gaza situation today in Saudi Arabia? DOOCY: A fair amount, Bret, Secretary Rubio is telling -- posted on X rather, I should say, that he told the Saudis, the United States is still committed to a cease fire in Gaza and releasing all of the hostages. In his official statement, though, on social media, he does not mention anything about President Trump's planned takeover of Gaza, Bret. BAIER: Peter Doocy live on the North Lawn. Peter, thanks. President Trump wants to fire -- after the animation, he wants to fire the head of the Special Counsel's Office, an institution with which he has an unpleasant history. He is asking the U.S. Supreme Court for permission. This comes amid legal wins for the president and his effort to cut government waste. Correspondent Alexandria Hoff tells us where things stand right now the. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CROWD: Elon Musk has got to go. ALEXANDRIA HOFF, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Presidents' Day served as the backdrop for protests in several cities against President Trump and Elon Musk's efforts to reduce government waste. With the holiday also came a rare court hearing and a temporary DOGE victory. Obama appointed federal judge Tanya Chutkan, who oversaw President Trump's election interference case declined for now to halt DOGE from accessing federal data and making personnel cuts within seven federal agencies. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is about restoring democracy. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is about checks and balances. HOFF (voice over): 14 state attorneys general are seeking to temporarily restrict DOGE's access to sensitive government systems. Judge Chutkan stated that she will issue a ruling on the request within 24 hours, but did express skepticism on the A.G.'s argument that DOGE poses imminent harm. This weekend, DOGE celebrated another stop gap win with U.S. District Judge John Bates denying a temporary restraining order to block DOGE access to the records of three agencies, the Labor Department, Health and Human Services and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Judge Bates acknowledged privacy concerns argued by workers unions, but ultimately decided that does likely qualifies as a federal agency and therefore has the authority to access government records. A separate emergency appeal is poised to become the first legal challenge of the president's second term to reach the Supreme Court. It involves President Trump's decision to fire the Chief of the Office of the special counsel the federal worker watchdog. (END VIDEOTAPE) HOFF (on camera): Fox News has obtained a copy of the appeal filed by the Justice Department, arguing that no court in American history has forced a president to retain the head of a government agency, Bret. BAIER: Alex, thank you. President Trump's new environmental chief wants to take back $20 billion that the Biden administration earmarked for climate projects. This comes as the president pushes to freeze all climate funding from the federal government. Here's Fox Business correspondent Grady Trimble. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GRADY TRIMBLE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The environmental protection agency wants to claw back billions of dollars the Biden administration set aside for green energy groups but never delivered. LEE ZELDIN, EPA ADMINISTRATOR: We're not talking about chump change here, we're talking about billions of your tax dollars. TRIMBLE (voice over): EPA officials tell Fox, the previous administration at the last minute, parked $20 billion in a bank with the goal of doling it out to climate organizations as part of a ""rush job with reduced oversight."" Administrator Lee Zeldin says the money from the so called Inflation Reduction Act was going to these groups and others. He's calling on the EPA to end its agreement with the bank where the money is sitting, and for the bank to return all of it. ZELDIN: We at the EPA and inside the Trump administration have zero tolerance for wasting abuse. We're coming down hard on this. TRIMBLE (voice over): Separately, he's already canceled a $50 million grant for the Climate Justice Alliance, for its pro-Palestinian stance, the head of that organization is blaming the Biden administration for not processing that money in time, while also criticizing the Trump administration, saying, despite claims that this administration will protect clean water and clean air for the nation, it has attacked basic protections for neglected communities from day one. But the head of the RNC says voters elected Trump to carry out sweeping changes like this. MICHAEL WHATLEY, RNC CHAIRMAN: The people who are screaming the most right now are the people who are affected by these cuts. The fact is that the taxpayers, the voters of America, have said no more. (END VIDEOTAPE) TRIMBLE (on camera): Some experts say the EPA could face legal challenges if it polls that $20 billion because it was awarded as part of a law that Congress passed and President Biden signed. We've reached out to the organizations involved, Bret, but we haven't heard back. BAIER: All right. Grady, thank you. Tonight, sources are confirming to Fox News that Department of Government Efficiency access is imminent to the Internal Revenue Services Integrated Data Retrieval System. It contains sensitive taxpayer information. Critics are warning against this. However, career IRS employees have access to that system for their jobs on a daily basis. DOGE supporters point out the department's political appointees are federal government employees and need access to the system to perform their duties. Watch this space. Stock markets closed today for the Presidents' Day holiday, back tomorrow. We will talk in depth with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Tomorrow, SPECIAL REPORT will be live from inside the Treasury Department tomorrow night, 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ZELENSKYY: I will never accept any decisions between the United States and Russia about Ukraine. This is the war in Ukraine against us, at these are our human losses. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't think this is about excluding anybody. In fact, it's about including everybody. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you expect Zelenskyy to be involved in these conversations? What will his role be? TRUMP: Yes, I do. He will be involved, yes. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Well, the setting the table for these negotiations happening in Saudi Arabia now with U.S. and Russian officials, let's talk about where things stand as we get ready to possibly see the end, or an end to the Ukraine-Russia war. We'll see. Joining us tonight, Fox News Chief Political Analyst, Brit Hume. Brit, good evening. You know your sense about this and how President Trump plays in all this, as European officials are scrambling to try to figure it out. BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, they sure are scrambling, and you can see why they're worried, and you can certainly see why voter Volodymyr Zelenskyy is worried as well. What he's afraid of -- Zelenskyy is afraid of is that the U.S. will sit down with Russia, and they'll get sold out in a deal between the U.S. and Russia to end that war, which President Trump obviously very badly wants to do, thinks is a -- thinks it's a foolish war on both sides. The Russian -- and the Europeans, meanwhile, having gotten a dose of Vice President Vance over the weekend, criticizing them for weakness and saying that, but we can -- we can no longer, as the United States be relied upon to provide all their security, and they're worried too. This sounds like classic Trump. He doesn't mind disrupting things. He doesn't mind being the bull in the China shop. But you can see he has a goal here. He wants to get this war over with. I don't think he's going to -- I don't think he's going to sell out Ukraine. I think this early talks in Saudi Arabia are just about the contours of the table in all likelihood. And obviously, you can't make peace between two countries when you're only negotiating with one. So, obviously, over time, there's no doubt in my mind that Zelenskyy will be involved, but I think the brief assurance we heard from President Trump on that airport tarmac is probably not going to satisfy Zelenskyy at least for the moment. BAIER: You have the U.K. Prime Minister saying that they may send U.K. British troops into Ukraine to be peace keepers. And, you know, interesting things coming out about what Europe is saying, concerned that maybe this is -- they're not going to get the security agreement that Ukraine wants and Europe wants. But clearly President Trump is driving this train. HUME: Yes, he certainly is, and he must have been encouraged today by what the Secretary General of NATO, Mark Rutter said about the U.S. position on this, which was that it was entirely fair and that the U.S. had a right to complain that Europe doesn't pay its full freight and have strong enough military to deal with the challenges are now facing that continent. So, I think it's, you know, the president appears, at least they got something started here. Now we'll all play out, obviously, remains to be seen, but he's got something going here. He's got -- I guess he's got Macron is going to rush to Washington to seek reassurance or something. So, this is all going to be -- this is -- we're going to -- this is going to make a lot of news in the next few weeks, Bret, I think it's pretty clear. BAIER: Definitely, definitely and very quickly. It's also interesting the Crown Prince in Saudi Arabia wants to be the facilitator here. I think he wants to be a centerpiece in world negotiations. HUME: Yes, I think he'd like very much to bring his country into the sort of the world mainstream, and one can hope that this is a sign that he might also be willing, when the dust settles over Gaza, to move forward with the hope for agreement with and normalization of relations with Israel, that would be quite a remarkable breakthrough if that were to happen. BAIER: Well, indeed, it's all going very fast. Brit, as always. Thank you very much. Up next, Elon Musk and his budget cutters are coming for the Pentagon. We'll take a look at what they may find there. First, here's what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. Fox 29 in Philadelphia, as the New York State Troopers capture a man wanted for the murder of his former girlfriend in Philadelphia. A U.S. Marshal describes Geovanni Otero as a lifelong criminal. The body of Melody Rivera was found buried in a shallow grave in Philadelphia's Fox Chase neighborhood last November. Fox 2 in Detroit as a water main break leaves several streets in the southwest part of the city under water. Residents woke up to vehicles stuck in icy water, toppled trash cans and floating garbage bags after the main break sent water flowing through that neighborhood. And this is a live look at San Francisco from our affiliate Fox 2 out there. One of the big stories there tonight, San Francisco based Uber, launches a nationwide seven figure digital ad campaign to push for legal and insurance reform in California and three other states. Uber says 32 percent of every Uber fare in the Golden State goes to paying for mandatory commercial insurance costs. It says those costs are ultimately passed down to passengers, impacting ride share, consumers and daily business for drivers. That's tonight's live look outside the Beltway from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: The Israeli military says its forces will remain in five strategic locations in southern Lebanon, near the border, after Tuesday's deadline for their withdrawal. That deadline is part of the team -- the terms, rather, of a cease fire with the Hezbollah militant group. Lebanon's government and the terror organization are opposed to any further delay in the withdrawal. Move comes as the region marks 500 days of unrest linked to the war in the Gaza Strip. Also tonight, the first congressional delegation to visit Israel since President Trump's inauguration met today with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other senior government officials. China's foreign ministry is taking issue tonight with a revised U.S. government fact sheet that removes a line on American opposition to independence for Taiwan. The ministry says the U.S. has ""gravely"" backpedaled on its position. It says the U.S. is sending the wrong message to separatist forces on the island. Tonight, The Pentagon is bracing for the intense scrutiny from Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The defense agency has never passed an audit. Think about that. Never passed an audit. And is notorious for contractor price gouging. Chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin takes a look tonight. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PETE HEGSETH, UNITED STATES DEFENSE SECRETARY: We welcome DOGE to The Pentagon. JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Tasked with cutting eight percent from the defense department's $850 billion budget, the first DOGE team members arrived last week at The Pentagon, which employs 3.7 million people and has never passed an audit. TARA DOUGHERTY, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, GOVINI: I would put a big red bull's eye on the process by which we manage weapons systems. GRIFFIN (voice over): A system that hasn't been updated in decades. DOUGHERTY: The defense acquisition process is massively broken. The United States is issuing missile purchases through fax machines. It's using spreadsheets and data calls. GRIFFIN (voice over): As a result, F-35 fifth-generation stealth fighter jets can't get out of depot because they're missing parts. The next generation intercontinental ballistic missile, a key part of the nuclear triad is $35 billion over budget. To get ahead of the DOGE team, the Navy is considering cutting its fleet of frigates, while the army is Looking for savings by eliminating outdated drones and surplus vehicles. SEN. ROGER WICKER (R-MS): I, for one, as chairman of the Armed Services Committee, welcome DOGE coming into The Pentagon and helping us cut tape. REP. EUGENE VINDMAN (D-VA): But the Department of Government and Efficiencies is causing a ray of terror, chaos, across the federal government. GRIFFIN (voice over): Concern the DOGE team will move too fast was realized after it purged 2,000 federal workers from the Department of Energy, including 350 who oversaw the nation's nuclear arsenal, many working at the Pantex Plant near Amarillo, Texas, reassembling nuclear warheads. (END VIDEOTAPE) GRIFFIN (on camera): The administration then did an about face last week and quickly tried to locate and rehire 350 Department of Energy employees overseeing the nukes. The Pentagon wants to avoid this kind of mistake by welcoming Elon's team and cooperating. Bret? BAIER: Jennifer Griffin, live at The Pentagon. Jennifer, thank you. Breaking tonight, a Delta Airlines flight from Minneapolis flipped upside down on landing at Toronto's airport today, everyone on the plane is accounted for. Three people are said to be in critical condition tonight. At least, 16 others were injured. Wind gusts were up to 40 miles per hour when the plane attempted to land. We're waiting for a news conference with more information. There have been a number of aviation incidents in recent weeks, including a commercial craft and a military helicopter, of course, above Washington, D.C., leading to those fatalities. A medical jet crash in Philadelphia and a flight that crashed into the sea ice near Alaska. Those incidents and others have prompted concerns about safety issues and staffing levels. The FAA responding today to a union's claim that it has fired probationary employees, saying it has retained employees who perform safety critical functions and, ""continues"" to hire an onboard air traffic controllers and safety professionals. Up next, a gruesome torture and murder of a transgender man in New York. We'll have those details. First, ""BEYOND OUR BORDERS"" tonight. The Vatican says Pope Francis' respiratory tract infection is presenting a complex clinical picture. It says the 88-year-old pontiff requires further hospitalization. He will undergo another change in his drug therapy in coming days. Officials in Egypt, meantime, say at least 10 people are dead following the collapse of a three-story residential building. Three others were hurt. It happened in the western part of greater Cairo. Search teams are now looking through the rubble for more victims. And this is a live look at El Sauzal, Mexico, one of the big stories there tonight. The Mexican army says it has seized more than four tons of methamphetamines in the violence ridden state of Sinaloa. Authorities say they found the drugs at the places such as laboratories and warehouses. The raid comes amid increasing pressure from the U.S. to crack down on the drug trade. Just some of the other stories ""BEYOND OUR BORDERS"" tonight. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Tonight in America's crime crisis we have a disturbing story from New York. A transgender man was tortured and killed. The motive unclear, but five people face murder charges. Correspondent Alexis McAdams has the gruesome details. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) JAMES RITTS (R), ONTARIO COUNTY, NEW YORK, DISTRICT ATTORNEY: This is by far the worst homicide investigation that our office has been a part of. ALEXIS MCADAMS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: An ongoing murder case in upstate New York shocking law enforcement as police say Sam Nordquist was tortured for weeks, then murdered. RITTS: No human being should have to endure what Sam endured. MCADAMS: The 24-year-old identified as a man, but despite his transgender status, authorities say they do not have an indication it's a hate crime. Five people are charged with murder in the second degree. Precious Arzuaga, Emily Motyka, Jennifer Quijano, Kyle Sage, and Patrick Goodwin. This is the New York motel where police believe Nordquist was beaten and assaulted with objects for days. Then detectives say the suspects dumped his body in a nearby field. CAPT. KELLY SWIFT, NEW YORK STATE POLICE: We've determined that Sam endured prolonged physical and psychological abuse at the hands of multiple individuals. MCADAMS: The victim's family tells FOX he met Arzuaga online last summer, then left his home in Minnesota to come see her in New York. They say he had plans to return home, but the last time he called was in January, so they reported him missing this month. MICHELLE PICKARD, NORDQUIST FAMILY FRIEND: Sam's a human being, a beautiful one, and it's just unfortunate that people are that disgusting, that ugly. MCADAMS: As police work to find a motive, we're learning more about some of the suspects, including their criminal history. Both Kyle Sage and Patrick Goodwin spent time behind bars for pedophilia convictions. (END VIDEO TAPE) MCADAMS (on camera): This is just a terrible story going through those details. I talked to Sam's mom, Bret, on the phone earlier. She said the details of the case are too disturbing for her to even comprehend right now. She's waiting to see the official cause of death from the coroner's report. Authorities say each of these suspect could face anywhere from 15 years to life behind bars if convicted. So we'll keep an eye on it, Bret? BAIER: Horrible story. Alexis, thank you. New York Democratic Mayor Eric Adams says four deputy mayors submitted their resignations this morning. Adams says he is disappointed to see them go, but he understands their decision. A statement by three of the officials cites what are called extraordinary events of the last few weeks and the desire to stay faithful to their oaths. The resignations are being characterized as the latest fallout from the Justice Department's push to end the corruption case against Mayor Adams and ensure his cooperation in President Trump's immigration crackdown. Tonight, there is now scrutiny on some of the agencies that received billions of dollars from the Biden administration to assist migrants. Critics say those programs lavished grants on illegal immigrants and encouraged that illegal immigration. Here's correspondent Brooke Taylor. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) BROOKE TAYLOR, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: $22 billion straight from taxpayers' pockets spent on migrants since 2020, according to a new report from a watchdog group Open the Books. Migrants from Cuba and Haiti, humanitarian parolees from Afghanistan and Ukraine, special immigrant visa holders from Afghanistan and Iraq, and unaccompanied minors were all eligible for these grants. The report reveals the funds went toward cars, homes, education, small business loans of up to $15,000, and loans to help repair credit scores. Open the books CEO says this hurt American taxpayers. JOHN HART, CEO, OPEN THE BOOKS: People in places like North Carolina, Los Angeles, that have lost everything, how is moral to ask them to pay the bill for someone who wants to come to this country illegally? That's outrageous. TAYLOR: The money was awarded through the Office of Refugee Resettlement, a division under the Health and Human Services Department. Both HHS And ORR have not responded to our request for comment. In 2020, according to the watchdog report, the ORR awarded $2.6 billion in grants. In 2023, the number more than tripled to $10 billion, and in 2024, $4 billion. While the grant money surged during a time migrant encounters at the southern border were at a record high, CBP reports that numbers are now the lowest they've seen in years. TOM HOMAN, WHITE HOUSE BORDER CZAR: I looked at the numbers today, 229 total encounters at the southwest border, 229. Compare that to 11,000 a day under Biden. (END VIDEO TAPE) TAYLOR (on camera): And according to the watchdog group, $12 billion went toward programs helping unaccompanied minors, but this is the same exact office that came under fire last year for allegedly losing track of 32,000 of these unaccompanied kids. Bret? BAIER: Brooke, thank you. FOX Weather Alert now. Historic flooding has left at least 11 people dead, leaving behind widespread damage in four states. There are fears those numbers could grow. The weather forecast not promising tonight. Correspondent Jonathan Serrie reports from Rives, Tennessee. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: This afternoon, first responders persuaded some of the last holdouts to evacuate homes surrounded by floodwaters after the weekend storm. Officials in Reeves, Tennessee, are used to dealing with rising water levels on the river that runs through their community of about 250 people, but say this time was different. CAMPBELL RICE, RIVES, TENNESSEE FIRE CHIEF: Once it started flowing over our levees, you know, everything we was pumping out came back in, so we had to shut the pumps down. And at that time it was over. So it's never ever that I have ever been here seen it this bad. SERRIE: President Trump has approved an emergency declaration for neighboring Kentucky where first responders rescued more than 1,000 people from the deadly and destructive floods. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We went to sleep at 10:00. Within six, seven hours it was up to the windows. And before too long, it was gone. SERRIE: State officials warn cold temperatures and snow this week will create additional hazards on already treacherous roads. GOV. ANDY BESHEAR, (D) KENTUCKY: What this means is water that's out there, we still have a lot can freeze. We're going to see black ice in different places during both the days and the nights, and how cold it's going to get, and remember the extra snow we're going to get. SERRIE: Despite immense losses, many storm survivors remain determined to rebuild. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's hard, but I start over, and I'll do better next time. I got to look at it that way. God's on my side. (END VIDEO TAPE) SERRIE (on camera): And sadly, a mother and her seven-year-old daughter died when floodwaters swept their vehicle off a road. That happened in Kentucky. Today state officials confirmed a total of 11 storm-related deaths in Kentucky and they warn that number could increase. Bret? BAIER: Jonathan Serrie live in Tennessee. Jonathan, thank you. Up next, the panel on talks between the U.S. and Russia about Ukraine. Plus, the continued fallout from the vice president's speech in Germany as you look live at Moscow, courtesy of Earth Cam. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: We're trying to get a peace with Russia- Ukraine, and we're working very hard on it. REP. MIKE WALTZ, (R-FL): President Trump initiated those talks personally with President Putin. He is ready to move quickly to end this conflict. And we will bring everyone together as appropriate. REP. EUGENE VINDMAN, (D-VA) HOUSE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE: The idea of the U.S. and Russia having these talks without participation from the E.U. and Ukraine is nonsensical. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Well, the talks to set up the talks beginning in Saudi Arabia. Meantime Reuters writes this, ""Russia rules out territorial concessions on the eve of talks with Trump team. The foreign minister on Monday ruling out territorial concessions to Ukraine, setting out a tough opening stance on the eve of talks on Tuesday with U.S. President Donald Trump's team in Saudi Arabia. A source with knowledge of the Kremlin thinking said on Monday that Putin was serious about doing a deal but not at any price. The Kremlin said the talks would focus on restoring Russian-U.S. relations in preparations for possible talks on ending the war."" Meantime, ""Macron and Trump have a frank conversation minutes before the European meeting on Ukraine. The French president and President Trump spoke on the phone minutes before Macron greeted European dignitaries who had gathered to discuss security in Paris. The French president's office said the frank conversation lasted the 20 minutes. The call came as European leaders are scrambling to come up with a unified response to the upheaval posed by Trump's second term"", as ""Politico"" writes it. Let's bring in our panel, Guy Benson, political editor at Townhall.com, host of ""The Guy Benson Show"" on FOX News Radio, ""Axios"" political reporter Stef Kight, and Matt Bennett, former deputy assistant to the president for intergovernmental under Bill Clinton and cofounder of Third Way. Guy, ""Politico"" says the upheaval and European leaders scrambling. They're basically trying to figure out what exactly President Trump wants, how he wants it, how it's going to go, because he's driving this train. GUY BENSON, ""THE GUY BENSON SHOW"" HOST: And maybe what their role is going to be moving forward. And I think part of that uncertainty is certainly by design from the Trump end of things, because this idea that, oh, gosh, what are the Americans going to agree to? What are the Americans going to commit to? Those are up in the air questions. I understand why a lot of European leaders would be uncomfortable with that, but I think that the discomfort comes with this expectation in Washington now and the new team that the European need to step up significantly in their commitment to their own continent and their own region. And we've seen some statements from bureaucrats and diplomats and others saying, well, the European Union and the European countries, we might respond by getting much more muscular within our own area. And I suspect the response from team Trump would be, great. BAIER: Bring it on, right? Stef, listen to President Zelensky responding to this initial volley of back and forth, how he's seeing it. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT: I will never accept any decisions between the United States and Russia about Ukraine. Never. I want to have a real meeting, productive, without just words, without contradictory steps, and to hear us, to hear President Trump, to make a common plan and to share it with allies, then with Russians, and stop this war. I think we need it urgently. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Stef, both the Reuters I read at the beginning, with the Russia stance heading in, Zelensky's stance right here, it's all pretalks setting the table. STEF KIGHT, POLITICAL REPORTER, ""AXIOS"": It is, but it's certainly sparking concerns for Ukraine and NATO allies of the U.S., the way that the Trump administration is going about this. they're clearly taking a very different path than the previous administration, going straight to Russia in many cases. And there are big questions about how involved Ukraine has been. And Zelensky's comments there show that he is not comfortable with how this discussion has been going so far. Of course, the talks are still early. We're not even at the point where they're saying they have any k",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 with Russia saying they're unwilling to cede any territory as their public opening bid, coming just a week after Pete Hegseth seemed to sort of gave away some of Ukraine's own bargaining chips, saying that inclusion in NATO is off the table, that pre-2014 boundary lines are not realistic. And so things have definitely been, for people close to Ukraine, NATO allies, they're concerned about how this goes about, but there's no question that Trump takes this very seriously and he plans to hatch a deal. This is the space that he feels comfortable in. He likes negotiating. And we'll see how tomorrow's talks go. BAIER: Yes, he thinks he can deliver deals on a number of fronts. Matt, there's still, as European leaders are scrambling to figure out the Ukraine negotiations, there's still fallout from Vice President Vance's speech in Germany at the Munich Security Conference. CBS having an interview with Secretary Rubio this weekend. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He was standing in a country where free speech was weaponized to conduct a genocide, and he met with the head of a political party that has far right views and some historic ties to extreme groups. The context of that was changing the tone of it. And you know that, that the censorship -- MARCO RUBIO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: I have to disagree with you. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: -- was specifically about the right. RUBIO: No, I have to disagree with you. Free speech was not used to conduct a genocide. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Vice President Vance responding on X, saying this," """"This is a crazy exchange. Does the media really think the holocaust was caused by free speech?"""" The fallout from that", Matt, pretty interesting on social media. MATT BENNETT, THIRD WAY CO-FOUNDER: It has been. And look, we got to remember the context. The vice president was standing in Germany, lecturing the Germans about free speech at a security conference while there is a war raging in Europe. And rather than discuss the war and talk about the things that are really worrying the Europeans, some of the things to Stet talked about, you know, the secretary of defense taking some of the things off the table, this meeting between the United States and Russia without the Ukrainians present. Those things were the things were driving the anxiety at the conference. Instead, Vice President Vance talked about, you know, free speech in Germany, and lectured them about shutting out the far right, a party that is kind of cozy with neo-Nazis, which is illegal under German law. It's not our system. It's theirs. And so I think what all of this backlash to his speech was generated by. BAIER: Yes, but, Guy, on the same CBS that asked that question about free speech and the holocaust," """"60 Minutes"""" ran a piece on German squelching free speech. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is it a crime to insult somebody in public? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes", it is. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And it's a crime to insult them online as well? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The fine could be even higher if you insult someone on the internet. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Why? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Because in internet it stays there. If we are talking face-to-face, you insult me, I insult you, OK, finished. But if you're on the internet, it finds out you are a politician. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Then it sticks around forever. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Those are German prosecutors," Guy. BENSON: No single clip does justice to this 13-minute segment on """"60 Minutes."""" It is almost unbelievable to watch. I encourage people to do so. It really confirms a key thesis of the vice president's speech in Germany. The Germans themselves confirming to CBS this is how we do things. We don't really believe in free speech. We believe in censorship very strongly. And the tone of the CBS report was enthralled. The CBS correspondent seemed almost envious of the German system. And one thing I'll say about it is", having watched it now twice, there was not a single -- there were five interviews done, five people featured on camera over the course of the interview. All five of them were in favor of government censorship of free speech, three prosecutors, a pro-censorship activist, and a pro-censorship left wing politician. Not even a 15-second clip for a pretense of balance, for someone who opposes government censorship of free speech in the CBS clip. So really confirming and fortifying what Vance has said here at home about the media and what he said in Munich to the Germans about their own country. He was not wrong. BAIER: All right, up next, the Department of Government Efficiency zeroes in on Social Security. Plus, a legal flurry for the Trump administration. Then, a very efficient way to get married and get some skiing in, too. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE HARIDOPOLOS, (R-FL): I really applaud the president for creating the DOGE and using a mastermind like Elon Musk. When we right-size the government, everybody wins. SEN. TIM KAINE, (D-VA): I'm all for government efficiency, but when you come in and the first thing you do is fire the inspector generals, hmm, those are the people whose job it is to find waste, fraud, and abuse. You send the message that efficiency isn't the goal. SEN. JOHN BARRASSO, (R-WY): We need to cut through the waste that we see that the Democrats continue to defend. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: OK, so Elon Musk, his DOGE team, going into Social Security, posting," """"According to the Social Security database", these are the numbers of people in each age bucket with the death field set to false. Maybe twilight is real," and there are a lot of vampires collecting Social Security."""" If you look here", more than 12 million people above the age of 120. The oldest person ever was 122. They're also finding, according to DOGE, tens of millions of people more than the population of the U.S. receiving Social Security payments. We're back with the panel. Matt, when they come out with this and all of the list of things that they're finding, there is a popularity to it. There is like a populist thing, like, wait a second, why don't we cut this stuff? BENNETT: Well, it's certainly popular when Musk just lies about stuff on X as he did around Social Security. The things that Musk was posting on Social Security are totally preposterous. He's saying that 85 percent of Social Security payments are fraudulent, which is nonsense. Elon Musk has no idea was he's talking about. And he doesn't have any idea what he's talking about when he goes into these agencies all at once with a hatchet and just starts swinging away. BAIER: So Matt, you don't believe the stuff that they're saying about the age, where they're finding 60 million more people than the population in the U.S.? BENNETT: No, I don't believe it, and I don't think anyone should believe it until we actually see evidence that isn't just Musk posting stuff on his own website. I think it's very evident that his tiny team of 22-year-olds has no idea what they're doing. I mean, they're firing air traffic controllers, they're firing firefighters, they're firing people fighting avian flu. They're firing people counseling veterans in crisis. This is an insane way of trying to bring efficiency to government. But it is clear, as Senator Kaine made clear, Democrats would applaud to bring efficiency to government, even, and we would reaction that there are things that a Republican would do that we would like. But this ain't it. BAIER: It just hasn't happened. It just hasn't happened from Capitol Hill, Guy. BENSON: Right. I mean, they would applaud if something were done that they themselves have not done. Now, do I agree that some of these things have been done too hastily and we saw some backtracking, Jennifer Griffin reported on some that on that earlier? Yes. I understand haste, but doing it the right way matters as well. And so I think they'd be well served to remember there are four years in this term. They don't have to squeeze everything in immediately. But the idea that there are no big amounts of low hanging fruit to really come after immediately, I think Americans understand that is the case if they do it carefully. BAIER: And quickly, Stef, there will be some level of oversight here, testimony on Capitol Hill. By the way, Elon and President Trump will be in Sean Hannity tomorrow going in depth on this. KIGHT: Certainly. And Congress is going to want answers and particulars on how Musk is going about deciding what gets cut and what doesn't get cut. And we're already starting to hear from some Republican lawmakers even who are concerned about the extensiveness of these cuts and the impact that it can have on Republican states and Republican districts. BAIER: OK. Panel, thanks so much. OK, finally tonight, a special day. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: By the power vested in my be the great city of Colorado, I pronounce you married. You may kiss. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Pretty cool. Dozens of couples say," """"I do"""" simultaneously on Valentine's Day at Loveland ski area in Colorado. The 34th annual mountaintop matrimony",12,000 feet above sea level, a record 130 couples clicked into their skis and snowboards to converge together near the continental divide. At least 300 couples have gotten married in the annual event's history. Very cool. Tomorrow on SPECIAL REPORT, we will be live inside the Treasury Department. I'll talk exclusively with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about how he'll implement the president's vision for the economy. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for this SPECIAL REPORT, fair, balanced," and still unafraid. Here's Laura.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Interview With Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R- AL ),2025-01-23T00:00:00Z,Will Cain,"YOUR WORLD WITH NEIL CAVUTO 4:22 PM EST Tommy Tuberville Fox News, YOUR WORLD WITH NEIL CAVUTO4:22 PM EST, NEWS; Domestic, 720words",U.S. Federal; Alabama; Alaska; Maine,"WILL CAIN, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: But back to Capitol Hill, two moderate Republicans have said they will not support Pete Hegseth`s nomination for secretary of defense. Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, Maine Senator Susan Collins say they`re not going to vote for Pete Hegseth. How`s that going over with other Republicans? Let`s ask Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville. Coach is a friend of ""The Will Cain Show."" He has told me to call him Coach. But I -- in all decorum here, it is the FOX News Channel, and I must call you Senator. Senator Tuberville, thanks for being here. What do you think about these holdouts among the GOP when it comes to Pete Hegseth? SEN. TOMMY TUBERVILLE (R-AL): Well, first of all, Will, look at the big picture. He got 51 votes. That pushed him to a vote tomorrow night at 9:00. So less than 30 hours from now, we will have a new secretary of defense once he gets sworn in at the White House. People are going to vote the way they want to up here, especially on the Republican side. I have dealt with it for four years. But at the end of the day, it was chaos on the Senate floor before the vote. You had Democrats going over to Republicans. They even came to me. Coach, you`re going to be disappointed in this guy. He`s going to let us all down. They`re scrambling. The new world order socialists, globalists lost. And they understand that this is the area that they really can`t lose. When you lose your military, your national defense agency, basically, and they don`t have control of it anymore, we`re going to do away with social justice DEI. We`re going to have great recruiting. We`re going to put discipline back in the military. That is exactly opposite what the Democrats want. So thank God, Pete Will, get confirmed some time this weekend and we`re off to the races. CAIN: Perfect. I couldn`t think of it to be more poetic that Pete Hegseth is confirmed on the weekend, of course, former weekend host of ""FOX & Friends."" I`m really glad to hear as well that your colleagues call you Coach. Makes me feel like I`m not totally out over my skis or out of bounds. I do -- you brought up, by the way, the new world order. You talked about the globalist mind-set. Pretty remarkable, by the way, senator, to hear Donald Trump today then speaking to those at Davos. This is some of what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Three days ago, I took the oath of office and we began the golden age of America. What the world has witnessed in the past 72 hours is nothing less than a revolution of common sense. Our country will soon be stronger, wealthier and more united than ever before. And the entire planet will be more peaceful and prosperous as a result of this incredible momentum and what we`re doing and going to do. My message to every business in the world is very simple. Come make your product in America and we will give you among the lowest taxes of any nation earth. If you don`t make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then, very simply, you will have to pay a tariff. Under the Trump administration, there will be no better place on Earth to create jobs, build factories or grow a company than right here in the good old USA. (END VIDEO CLIP) CAIN: You know, Senator, it seems a pretty simple message. Hey, America`s the best place in the world to do business. And if you choose to do so in America, we will incentivize it and make it the best for you. If you choose to do it somewhere else, it`s not going to be so easy. There will be tariffs. TUBERVILLE: Exactly. The inauguration speech, Will, he called out the Bidens, the Clintons, the Obamas right to their face. And he did the same thing to the people at Davos, all these woke climate change hoax people, that they live for themselves. They don`t live for the world. They don`t live for anything other than making themselves richer. President Trump basically said, get on the ship or get off, folks, because we are changing the order of which we`re doing business. And if you want to do business with America, you better move here and make it, because, if you don`t make it in America, we`re going to tax the hell out of you. CAIN: All right, Senator, Coach Tommy Tuberville, always great to see you. Thanks for being on ""The Will Cain Show."" TUBERVILLE: Thank you, Will.

A federal raid in Colorado was supposed to grab 100 violent gang members. We will tell you what went wrong. Our ""COMMON GROUND"" segment on how House Problem Solver Caucus is working on bipartisan issues, and security officials in New Orleans aim to put on the safest Super Bowl ever. But first, BREAKING TONIGHT"", the White House is welcoming a judge's decision to postpone the deadline for federal workers to take a buyout offer. They will have until at least next week to consider the deal. Presidents also complimenting his government efficiency expert at a time when Elon Musk is taking heavy criticism from Democrats. Senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy, starts us off tonight, live from the North Lawn. Good evening, Peter. PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. The White House claims to almost entirely wipe out the USAID workforce. Out of 10,000 employees, right now, they plan to keep 294 of them, according to a Reuters bulletin that just crossed. The White House is also now, tonight, on the receiving end of a federal lawsuit from a dozen states, were trying to stop Elon Musk and his small team of DOGE engineers from accessing the personal information of federal employees. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Elon Musk is helping us on it, and he is pretty good. DOOCY (voice over): As DOGE engineers continue pouring over federal spending, federal workers now have an extra four days to mull over a buyout offer. The White House press secretary, says, ""We are grateful to the judge for extending the deadline so more federal workers who refuse to show up to the office can take the administration up on this very generous once in a lifetime offer."" But some Democratic lawmakers say it might be too good to be true. SEN. MARK WARNER (D-VA): I've been saying to all the federal employees, beware of this offer. I don't believe it's been funded. DOOCY (voice over): To comply with yesterday's executive order on women's athletics, the NCAA has updated its rules. ""The new policy limits competition in women's sports to student athletes assigned female at birth only. The policy permits student athletes assigned male at birth to practice with women's teams and receive benefits such as medical care while practicing."" Today's executive orders designed to put Attorney General Pam Bondi in charge of a religious freedom task force. TRUMP: The task force will work to fully prosecute anti-Christian violence and vandalism in our society. DOOCY (voice over): Today, the NTSB brief lawmakers about first week findings in the probe of last Wednesday's midair collision near DCA. SEN. JERRY MORAN (R-KS): We were assured that the personnel at the air -- at the tower was consistent with normal practices. DOOCY (voice over): Hillary Clinton disagrees, claiming that because of Trump federal staffing cuts, there have been two fatal crashes. For his part, the president is trying to put what he knows about the collision into layman's terms. TRUMP: Did you ever see, you go to a driving range in golf, and you're hitting balls, hundreds of balls, thousands of hours? I never see a ball hit another ball. It was a lot of mistakes made, and it should have never happened. (END VIDEOTAPE) DOOCY (on camera): The president and key Republican lawmakers met here at the White House for more than four hours today to try to iron out details of a big spending bill to address all the Trump priorities that cannot be executive ordered. Speaker Johnson just said he thinks they should have details available by later on tonight. Also, spotted here at the White House today, for reasons unknown as of this show, Mark Zuckerberg. Brett? BAIER: All right. Meta's chief. The first world leader to attend to see the president at the White House, obviously, the Israeli prime minister, Tomorrow, he gets another? DOOCY: Yes. Just while that taped package was playing, we could hear the motorcade for the Japanese Prime Minister Ishiba, pulling up to Blair House across the street. He is going to be here for some sort of activities with the president tomorrow. And Japan is key, because from everything that every Republican and Democratic analyst says, countering Chinese influence in the world is going to be key, particularly when it comes to A.I. tech, and the race to secure the future of A.I. So, we don't know exactly what the plan is for tomorrow, but Mr. Ishiba is already here. Bret? BAIER: All right. Peter Doocy, live on the North Lawn. Peter, thanks. President Trump's immigration reform policy is resulting in an increased effort to find and deport illegal immigrants. But that did not go as planned yesterday in Colorado, and there is already significant resistance from Democratic leaders in sanctuary cities. Least effort to find and deport illegal immigrants. But that did not go as planned yesterday in Colorado, and there is already significant resistance from Democratic leaders in sanctuary cities. We have ""FOX TEAM COVERAGE"" tonight. Mike Tobin is in Chicago with details on the sanctuary locations and what the administration is doing about it. First up, correspondent Bill Melugin in Aurora, Colorado. Good evening, Bill. BILL MELUGIN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Bret, good evening to you. Federal officials tell us it felt like this huge operation was really just doomed from the very beginning, when they first got things rolling. There had been leaks to the media, there were articles written that this operation was coming, and as a result, they fell very, very short of their goal of arresting dozens of Tren de Aragua gang members. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TOM HOMAN, FORMER ACTING DIRECTOR, IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT: We have already identified how this operation got leaked. I'll deal with that today. MELUGIN (voice over): Border czar Tom Homan, heeded on Fox today and reacting to a failed federal operation in Aurora, Colorado that ICE officials believe was derailed due to leaks to the media. Homan addressed the issue outside the White House today. HOMAN: This isn't a game. When operations get leaked like that, puts our officers at great risk. It's already a dangerous job, but when they get heads up, we're coming, it's only a matter of time before officers are ambushed. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey, guys we can roll it up. MELUGIN: Fox News was embedded exclusively in Wednesday's operation, which involved hundreds of federal agents from ICE, HSI, FBI, DEA, ATF, and CBP, they were targeting roughly 100 Tren de Aragua gang members at problematic apartment complexes in the Aurora area. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Police, open the door. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Police. Open the door! UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE)! MELUGIN (voice over): Fox News joined as one team of feds arrived at the complex that went viral last summer with trend de Aragua, gang members seemed armed with guns in its hallways. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (INAUDIBLE) MELUGIN (VOICE OVER): As the team went door to door throughout the complex, they found blood-stained walls, but no gang members. The entire complex was virtually empty. At several other complexes, more of the same. Fox is told, overall, despite the huge amount of federal resources, only 30 arrests were made. One of which was a member of TDA, far short of the goal of 100 members the operation was targeting. MELUGIN: It seems like they were tipped off. They knew this was coming. CALEB VITELLO, ACTING DIRECTOR, IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT: I do get the impression that there were some intel leaks here, and I think that probably they did know we were coming, but we're still coming. And just because something leaks now and then doesn't -- it's not going to stop us. MELUGIN (voice over): An Aurora City councilwoman points the finger at local activists. DANIELLE JURINSKY, AT-LARGE MEMBER, AURORA CITY COUNCIL, COLORADO: We have some activist groups that are going around and moving migrants around and telling them not to answer their doors. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Leave them alone to peace! You are -- MELUGIN (voice over): Those activists were out in full force at multiple locations during the operation. Many taunted ICE. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Get the -- out of my neighbors! UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Out! Get out! UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE) holes! UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What the -- is wrong with you? Get out of our community! MELUGIN (voice over): Others coached people living in the buildings that ICE targeted. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (text): Remain silent. Don't open the door. MELUGIN (voice over): Homan has a message for them. HOMAN: They may find themselves in pair handcuffs very soon. We're not going to tolerate anymore. (END VIDEOTAPE) MELUGIN (on camera): And Bret, Homan said today, he plans to work with the department of justice to look into potentially prosecuting anybody who he feels is interfering with ICE operations. He also added he may have to cut off media access to these ICE operations as a result of what he says are repeated leaks. We'll send it back to you. BAIER: Amazing video. Live in Aurora, Bill, thanks. The president's pick to run the justice department and go on the offensive against the sanctuary movement in cities and states is already taking action. Senior correspondent Mike Tobin has that part of the story from Chicago. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAM BONDI, ATTORNEY GENERAL NOMINEE, FLORIDA: I will support and defend the Constitution. MIKE TOBIN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: As quickly as Attorney General Pam Bondi took the oath, a rapid-fire battle against sanctuary policies was underway. With a lawsuit seeking to block several state and local laws like the Illinois TRUST Act and Chicago's Welcoming City act, claiming that they are, ""designed to and in fact, interfere with, and discriminate against the federal government's enforcement of federal immigration law in violation of the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution."" Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, responded, saying, ""Instead of working with us to support law enforcement, the Trump administration is making it more difficult to protect the public, just like it did when Trump pardoned the convicted January 6 violent criminals. We look forward to seeing them in court."" In a separate action, the attorney general directed a pause on federal grants that would flow to Chicago because of sanctuary policies. RAY LOPEZ, MEMBER, CHICAGO CITY COUNCIL: When it comes to public safety, our police department is heavily grant dependent from the federal government, and this will put us in a -- in a bind. TOBIN (voice over): All this as the House Oversight Committee has launched an investigation of jurisdictions that refused to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. The mayors of Boston, Denver, and Chicago, have all been called up to defend their positions. BRANDON JOHNSON, MAYOR OF CHICAGO: Chicago is a city that opens its arms to people from around the globe. We will continue to protect civil and human rights. (END VIDEOTAPE) TOBIN (on camera): In a clear act of defiance, the Illinois governor has banned people pardon for January 6 from getting jobs with the state. A resolution that does the same thing in Chicago has been drawn up to be presented to the Chicago City Council February 19th. Bret. BAIER: Mike Tobin, live in Chicago. Mike, thanks. We are waiting a Senate confirmation vote on President Trump's pick to be budget director. Meanwhile, there is a delay in the process for the nominee to lead the FBI. And the man behind the Department of Government Efficiency, as we've been talking about, is getting an earful from Capitol Hill. Senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has our update from the Hill. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): A simultaneous multi-level fight over FBI director nominee Kash Patel, Budget director pick, Russ Vought, and Elon Musk. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: None of us went out in the elections and said, if you elect me, I will promise to cower before the first bully who shows up. PERGRAM (voice over): Democrats mounting a resistance with a blockade of Patel. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Kash Patel has a goal. It's to wreck the FBI. PERGRAM (voice over): Democrats temporarily bottled-up Patel's nomination in committee. PERGRAM: So, this is going to be delayed for a week, but no hearing. SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL): Customary delay of a week. PERGRAM (voice over): That chokes off Patel's nomination from the Senate floor until at least next Thursday. SEN. CHUCK GRASSLEY (R-IA): It means that about 168 hours from right now, he'll be confirmed by our committee. PERGRAM (voice over): On the floor, Democrats stretched out debate on votes nomination, chewing up time with a rare all-night session. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are out of power, but we are not powerless. But suspended animation only lasts so long. Rules compel a final roll call to confirm vote tonight. Democrats pivoted to their new nemesis. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Nobody elected Elon Musk to be president, but he has his grimy hands all over our administration. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Elon Musk, we've got a message for you. You will be fired -- PERGRAM (voice over): But most Republicans support Musk and his efforts to unearth what they believe is wasteful spending. SEN. ERIC SCHMITT (R-MO): I think, permanent Washington is shaking right now. There is a reckoning coming. And the American people support this. (END VIDEOTAPE) PERGRAM (on camera): The Senate likely confirms vote within the hour. Democrats believe he may undercut congressional spending powers. Vote likely becomes the second nominee confirmed only by the GOP. Bret? BAIER: Chad Pergram, live on the Hill. Chad, thank you. Wall Street drifted to a mixed close as drops for Ford Motor and Qualcomm worked against buoyant fashion and tobacco stocks. The Dow lost 126. The S&P 500 was up 22. The NASDAQ gained 100. Up next, the judge delays action on the dispute over naming FBI agents involved in the January 6th investigations. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: We have additional details from the previously mentioned NTSB briefing to lawmakers on that air collision over Washington. Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Ted Cruz says a key safety system was turned off on the U.S. Army helicopter that collided with the passenger jet last week that offsetting for the ADS-B system is permitted for military aircraft during a training mission. Flights into Reagan National Airport are also being reduced from 28 to 26 arrivals an hour. Officials said the move will lead to some delays, but improve safety after 67 people died in last week's accident, there were no survivors. The U.S. Navy reportedly has successfully tested a laser weapon on one of its warships, the so called HELIOS system, was able to hit an aerial drone during a testing exercise last year. This is an image from that test. The 60 plus kilowatt laser was delivered to the Navy in August of 2022 when it became the first tactical laser system installed in existing ships. Speaking of ships, Iran has inaugurated its first drone carrier warship. It says the vessel is capable of operating in oceans far from its mainland. The report says the vessel will be manned by the paramilitary revolutionary guard's Navy. It says the ship can carry several squadrons of drones as well as helicopters and cruise missiles. Panama's president is denying the State Department's claim that his country has reached a deal allowing American warships to transit the Panama Canal for free. Jose Raul Mulino says he told Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth he could neither set the fees to transit the Canal nor exempt anyone from them. Mulino says he is talking with President Trump tomorrow. The Panama Canal Authority also denies making any adjustments to the fees. At least denies it as of yet. We will have to wait a little longer to get a judge's decision on whether the public can see the names of FBI personnel involved in Capitol riot investigations. Tonight, Correspondent David Spunt takes a look at what happened today. Good evening, David. DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Bret, good evening to you. The entire court hearing today was about keeping a list of FBI agents who worked January 6th cases in an investigative manner out of public hands, lawyers for the FBI Agents Association said in federal court today here in Washington that the risk is, ""horrendous,"" if that list gets out. This was a six hour hearing. Should have been only about an hour, but went a judge delayed this decision over whether to block the DOJ or government as a whole from releasing a list with thousands of FBI agents and other Bureau employees. The judge will pick up where she left off with both sides tomorrow. The hearing comes, Bret, after a tense back and forth between FBI's acting leadership and the Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove who last week told the FBI's leaders to instruct more than 4,000 employees nationwide to explain their roles in the January 6th 2021 Capitol riot cases via a questionnaire. Bove received the surveys earlier this week, the FBI Agents Association made up of about 14,000 active agents sued DOJ to keep the identities private. The fight in court today was over the word government. The FBI agent's attorneys wanted a promise from the DOJ that no one in the entire government would release this list. The DOJ lawyer could not commit to that promise, pointing to the size of the entire government, he said he hoped to give more answers tomorrow. Meanwhile, the head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Pam Bondi was not in Washington today, but in New Orleans, ahead of Sunday's Super Bowl game. She met with FBI officials and local law enforcement for briefings on the security plan for the next few days following the terrorist attack in the city, 14 victims tragically killed on New Year's Day. The Attorney General has indicated, Bret, one of her top priorities for DOJ, stopping violent crime. Back to you. BAIER: We'll take you down to New Orleans later in the show. David Spunt, thanks. Up next, our Common Ground segment on the work of the bipartisan House problem solvers caucus, what they're talking about. First, Beyond our Borders tonight, Ukraine's general staff says its forces struck an airfield in southern Russia that was being used to launch drones designed by Iraq. Also tonight, France says it has delivered the first batch of Mirage fighter jets to Ukraine, and the Netherlands has sent additional F-16. Authorities in Sweden say the shooter who killed 10 people at an adult education center this week was connected to that facility. It was the country's worst ever mass shooting. They say the still unidentified gunman may have attended school there. He was found dead after that gunfire in Sweden. And this is a live look at Rome. One of the big stories there tonight, scientists say they have cracked the code for boiling the perfect egg. The study was authored by a researcher from the University of Naples in Italy. The recipe involves transferring eggs in a steamer basket every two minutes between two bowls of water. One bowl has boiling water, the other lukewarm at 86 degrees Fahrenheit. This goes on for 32 minutes. This transfer before cooling under running water and then peeling. There you go. Perfect. Just some of the other stories Beyond our Borders tonight. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): Nothing screams democracy like having a secret squad of company men pull off a hostile takeover of America's Social Security and tax information in the dead of night. That's democracy? REP. NICK BEGICH (R-AK): This is good news for the American people, and we should welcome this kind of input and oversight. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Talking there about DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency under Elon Musk. But in tonight's Common Ground segment, getting Congress to work together with the president. Joining us are New York Democratic Congressman Tom Suozzi and Pennsylvania Republican Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick. They are co-chairs of the house problem solvers caucus. Thank you both for being here. You are from a district that Kamala Harris won in 2024, you are from a district that Donald Trump won in 2024. As a Democrat, you wrote this op-ed in January saying, let's try something different in how we deal with Trump. Every word he's ever spoken has been criticized, yet he just won again. People are exhausted by the endless finger pointing, nit picking and daily battling for political advantage. We've talked about that. How do you see it shaping up at this point? REP. TOM SUOZZI (D-NY): Well, you know, the natural inclination is that you know, you take a punch at me, I'm going to take a punch at you. And we've had enough of that in our country, I think, with everybody attacking each other. And it's not easy right now, because the president, you know, is doing a lot of stuff right now. It's coming at us with like a fire hose. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We will not waste a single moment in delivering on our promises to the people. (END VIDEO CLIP) SUOZZI: And people are concerned they don't really know what's going on. But one of the things that Brian and I are focused on is, where can we find common ground on things like immigration and the border, on the budget, on the deficits, on permitting reform, on mental health, what can we do to fight against the tide that's coming at us? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Fire who? CROWD: Elon Musk! (END VIDEO CLIP) BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Congressman Fitzpatrick, this concern about DOGE, specifically from Democrats, there are some Republicans, too, about how this process is going. Republicans for a long time said they never wanted unelected bureaucrats to make decisions on policy and what exactly was happening. Is that happening, and is that criticism something that's real? REP. BRIAN FITZPATRICK, (R-PA): I think two things can be true. Number one, sensitive data, taxpayer protected information will be protected. No private citizen could ever have access to that. It's already a -- that would be a violation of current law. BAIER: You don't think Elon Musk has access to that? FITZPATRICK: We have been told that's not true. That's the most recent information we have, that he does not have access to that. And it can also be true that career bureaucrats who have been in the government their entire lives, who are completely checked out, who do not put their names on the ballot, are making decisions in lieu of elected officials. We need a shakeup in a lot of these agencies to make sure that we're cutting out fat, cutting out redundancy, fraud, waste and abuse. BAIER: Because waste, fraud, and abuse, Congressman, is over the top. If you go down into the weeds, there's a ton of it. SUOZZI: We should all be looking for efficiencies. But we really should be using the Congress as a vehicle to do that. And it shouldn't be just someone doing it on their own with eight 19 to 24-year-olds helping them. BAIER: Yes, but to be fair, we are always one election away from doing the big things, cutting the big things. Congress has -- when it talks about a cut, it's about cutting the increase. It's not about cutting the cut. SUOZZI: We have the Constitution, and we have requirements. And the Congress is responsible for this. So, listen, Elon Musk and DOGE, give us a list of the things that you think would make a lot of sense, bring it before the congress. And forget about the Democrats for a second. The Republicans have the presidency, they have the Senate, they have the House. Present the bill to try and make these things, have it debated in open, and figure out how to make these changes and make these efficiencies happen. BAIER: You on Problem Solvers have a long list of things that you want to get done together. But on immigration, can you produce something in a small package that is able to get bipartisan support? FITZPATRICK: I believe so. Tom and I went to the border together. We have a very similar view of the border. Number one, first and foremost, you have to secure the border. You have to stop the bleeding. I don't want to attend another funeral of any child dying in my district from a fentanyl overdose, which largely is coming from that southern border. SUOZZI: Democrats and Republicans need to stop attacking each other and find our common enemy. Who is our common enemy? Organized crime, cartels, coyotes that are exploiting people, charging them $10,000 apiece, making billions of dollars every quarter, and bringing people to our southern border, exploiting these people and abusing our system in the process. BAIER: Democrats had a problem with the tariff threat on Mexico and Canada, and yet, within 24 hours, before that was going to go into effect, both Canada and Mexico put 10,000 troops on the border. They agreed to pay all kinds of things to stop fentanyl. SUOZZI: They both initiated, both of those countries have initiated plans of that type already. We need to break the broken asylum system. If we don't fix the asylum system, if we just try and do it through reconciliation and don't fix the asylum system, which is going to require legislation, we're going to keep on seeing this problem for a long time. And we need take the president at his word and make a deal on the Dreamers, and also do something about the 50 percent of farm workers in America that are probably undocumented. BAIER: But to do that in a massive package, that includes taxes and everything else, which is one big beautiful bill, that's tough to herd those cats. FITZPATRICK: It is, because having one bill, and that's the House position that we're going with at the moment, the reason that they wanted that is because it makes it hard to vote against so many good things like border security when you have, for example, a lot of the New York Republicans that where SALT is a main issue, border security is a big issue in their districts as well. If we end up going down the two bill path that the Senate wants to do, you marry up energy to pay for border security, and then you deal with the efficiency piece to pay for the tax cuts. BAIER: All right, so a few weeks in, you guys are optimistic that you can work together and get something done? FITZPATRICK: We are. SUOZZI: It's going to be very hard, but yes, I'm optimistic. FITZPATRICK: We are. We came into Congress together. We're both attorneys and CPAs. You mentioned that we represent swing districts, both of us represent a district that the other party's president carried, and yet we have a solid relationship. We respect each other, and that's 90 percent of it, right. SUOZZI: And most people in Congress want to do the right thing. We just let ourselves be intimidated by the extremes on both sides instead of trying to find that common ground in the middle where we can work together and get things done. BAIER: That's why we created this segment a long time ago. Thank you both for being here. You can see all of the ""Common Ground"" segments on my podcast ""Common Ground."" Find that and the ""All-Star Panel"" podcast under the Bret Baier podcasts at FOXNewspodcast.com, Spotify, or wherever you download podcasts. You can also see the discussion on the FOX News YouTube page. Up next, super security at the Super Bowl. And later, the panel on President Trump's comments at the Washington Prayer Breakfast and what's happening today. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan says President Trump has brought the PGA Tour and the Saudi backed Liv Golf closer to a deal to reunify the game of golf. Monahan and player director Adam Scott met with President Trump at the White House Tuesday. Monahan says he asked the president to get involved for the good of the game. He added that he is grateful for President Trump's leadership that has brought the two sides closer to a final deal. Pretty exciting. We're just about 72 hours from the kick-off of Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans. The Big Easy is definitely not taking it easy when it comes to security. Correspondent Garrett Tenney shows us tonight from New Orleans. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't like that they're here, but I'm glad they're here. GARRETT TENNEY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: A month after a deadly ISIS inspired terror attack, officials say New Orleans has transformed into the safest place in America this week for the Super Bowl. ERIC DELAUNE, HOMELAND SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS: We would be foolish if we didn't learn and use what happened on January 1st to inform how we make changes. TENNEY: Those changes include new bollards and barriers on Bourbon Street that weren't used on New Year's, including the archer barriers that are designed to stop a high-speed vehicle attack. More than two dozen federal agencies are helping secure the Big Easy. DELAUNE: It's our job to feel in the gaps for our state and local partners and help them out as best as we can. TENNEY: And special agent in charge Eric Delaune is coordinating those efforts with state and local police. Or Bourbon Street heavily armored bearcat vehicles with Homeland Security special response teams are on standby. And National Guard troops are manning barricaded checkpoints to enforce a new enhanced security zone in the French quarter, which includes a ban on coolers and ice chests like the terrorists used to hide explosive last month. In the sky, our cameras went up in one of the Black Hawk helicopters patrolling the city. And on the water, we went out with CPB's air and marine operations. MATTHEW VALZANIA, CBP AIR AND MARINE OPERATIONS: We're predominantly looking for any sort of acts of terrorism or anything like that. TENNEY: More than 2,000 officers from local state and federal agencies are on hand, and city officials say their goal is to have a visible security presence on every single street downtown For the more than 100,000 fans expected. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They are everywhere. Their presence is known as well. TENNEY: Special agent Delaune says with all the additional resources federal resources that have been brought in since New York's, this will be the most secure Super Bowl in history. DELAUNE: We're talking to our counterparts at the NFL. This is the most organized and most secure Super Bowl that they have worked with. (END VIDEO TAPE) TENNEY (on camera): Federal officials say there are currently no specific credible threats on the Super Bowl, and that whoever wins on Sunday, they aren't concerned about celebrations getting out of hand, at least here in New Orleans. Bret? BAIER: Garrett Tenney live in New Orleans. Garrett, thanks. Up next, the panel on President Trump's comments at the Washington Prayer Breakfast and what's happening as of this hour. First, here's what some of our FOX affiliates around this country are covering tonight. FOX 11 in Los Angeles as a California utility says its equipment likely sparked a small wildfire that broke out the same day as two massive blazes in that area that killed at least 29 people and destroyed thousands of homes. The admission by southern California Edison over its likely role in the Hurst fire, which did not destroy any structures or result in any deaths, came in a required filing with state utility regulators. FOX 32 in Chicago, with the death of Bears owner Virginia McCaskey. She inherited the team from her father, the legendary George Halas. She avoided the spotlight during her four plus decades as principle owner. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell says McCaskey left a legacy of class, dignity, and humanity. Virginia McCaskey was 10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 our affiliate there. One of the bid stories there tonight, one of the last remaining American industrial conglomerates will split into three independent companies. Charlotte based Honeywell will separate from its automation and aerospace technology businesses. That is in addition to earlier plans to spin off its advanced materials business. That's tonight's live look outside the beltway from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: Today I'm signing an executive order to make our attorney general the head of a task force, brand new, to eradicate anti-Christian bias. After years of decline," Americans are reasserting our true identity as a people ordained by God to be the freest and most exceptional nation ever to exist on the face of the earth. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: President Trump with a speech at the Washington Prayer Breakfast. """"The Playbook"""" in """"Politico"""" says"," """"This guy might have energy. Trump might be the oldest president to ever swear the oath", but he's not slowing down. The pace of executive action has been off the charts, and Trump has made public appearances," taken media questions almost every single day. Each executive order signing turns into a press conference. Trump has dominated every moment of the news agenda. Joe Biden he is not."""" We'll start there with our panel. Let's bring in Leslie Marshall", Democratic strategist, Ben Domenech," editor at large for """"The Spectator"""" and host of """"The Ben Domenech Podcast"""" on FOX News Radio", and Annie Linskey," White House reporter for """"The Wall Street Journal"""". Annie", it is pretty amazing. And, you know, we have talked about the flow of everything that's happening. Today started with the Washington Prayer Breakfast and was kind of newsy in parts. ANNIE LINSKEY," """"WALL STREET JOURNAL"""": Yes. Absolutely. I think", you know," I sort of chuckled that the """"Politico"""" snippet that you read because", of course, Donald Trump isn't really the oldest president to take the oath. That would have been Joe Biden who was 82 when he left office. And the four years younger that Trump is really shows. I was at the White House all week, and at one point I was joking with my husband that I saw Donald Trump more than him one day, which is not great. But it is, you know, not complaining, of course. But, yes, today at the prayer breakfast, he was there. He has talking to an audience. It's a cherished tradition in Washington of bipartisan members of Congress go to this event. And it was Donald Trump yet again reaching out to Congress, a body that he's going to need to get his agenda through. But he was so, his talking to them this morning, talking to them this afternoon, and really communicating with this body that for so long has not felt the love from the president of the United States. BAIER: I haven't done the math, but I think they were saying when he took the actual oath, Biden four years ago. But, either way," """"Washington Post"""" has been"," """"The judge pauses federal worker buyout to offer a deadline", pushing it until two days after, and the U.S. district judge says now the deadline is Monday at 2:00 p.m. And they are going to see if that's when it starts again. So far we are being told that some 60,000 federal workers in the U.S. government have taken this buyout,60,000. And that number is likely to increase by Monday by this judge's order. BEN DOMENECH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. And I have to say I saw what Senator Warner was saying earlier about people saying that this is not going to be something that's lived up to. I think that given the size of people who are accepting it, it's absolutely going to be something that is going to have to be lived up to by this administration. And I, in fact, you know, as many people in the D.C. area, you know people, I know several people who have taken this buyout. And I think that they are going to be -- there is going to ultimately be a bigger number because it's an opportunity for people, and I think that they believe it's going to be something that comes through. Look, when it comes to reducing the size of the bureaucracy in Washington, I think that there is some knowledge, especially flowing out of Silicon Valley, that says, you know, let's give them a golden pathway out as opposed to trying to fight them on the way in. BAIER: There is a lot, Leslie, of talk about Elon Musk and how DOGE is operating, and Democrats really raising a stink about that. The Treasury Secretary says when it comes to Treasury, specifically, and those payment systems, he has personally vetted the Treasury employees in the DOGE effort, and the team who have read only access to federal payment data. And he talked a little bit about that with Larry Kudlow on Wednesday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SCOTT BESSENT, TRUMP'S TREASURY SECRETARY PICK: What I will tell you that at the Treasury, our payment system is not being touched. Everything -- we process 1.3 billion payments a year. There's a study being done, can we have more accountability, more accuracy, more traceability that the money is going where it is. But in terms of payments being stopped, that is happening upstream at the department level. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: So is this the right political attack to do for Democrats if people around the country, largely, are in support of trying to find waste, fraud and abuse in government? LESLIE MARSHALL, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: People around the country are wanting to find abuse and wanting to find fraud and want streamlining. But people around the country are less happy with Elon Musk, and that's not just on my side of the aisle. People around the country are very fearful of anybody, especially 19 to 24-year-olds who are not elected, who are not vetted, and, you know, what is their background and what do they have access to? And the big three words are Social Security numbers. People are very frightened about that. We have so much identity theft as there is without having a bunch of people who were not elected and that are not vetted possibly having access to this information. With all due respect, I don't believe what they're telling us, that they say nobody is going to touch this, nobody is going to touch payments. All you need is one person to go rogue, Bret, and to sell private information of not just union workers and not just people who are collecting Social Security or who are benefiting from Medicare or Medicaid, but anybody out there. I mean, you know, everybody in the United States of America has something with their Social Security number connected, whether it's because you paid taxes, you haven't paid taxes and they are going after you, you are receiving Social Security, you're receiving Medicare, or you will receive Social Security or Medicare, or you're receiving Medicaid. I mean, this is very dangerous in my opinion -- BAIER: Is there evidence that that has happened? Is there evidence that that's happened? The Secretary of Treasury says he has personally vetted the people -- MARSHALL: We're going to wait until it happens? BAIER: No, no, no. He has personally vetted the people that are going through the Treasury payment system, and that each agency is vetting the people that are going through the agency, that they can only get access to the materials that they can see, whether they are classified. They are agency employees is what each agency is saying. Now, if there is evidence of it, I haven't seen it yet. MARSHALL: Well, I do know that anybody who is going to hire these 19 to 24-year-olds, some that don't have a college education like Elon Musk, who is a very bright man, to work for a company like his, X, prior to joining DOGE, you don't think they have the ability to gain access to that without being vetted? BAIER: OK, Ben, what do you think? DOMENECH: I'm sorry. Can I interject here. Leslie, I'm sorry, I was 20 when I was the political appointee of the Bush White House in HHS. I had access to all sorts of things along these same lines. I don't know what you are talking about in terms of this ageist idea that because people who are young and smart who have been vetted by some of the same people who have been named to this cabinet have no ability to do their job and try to make the government function better. We've just emerged from a period in which we had our government run by the most decrepit White House, the most out-of-touch and eldest in terms of leadership. I don't think they did a very good job, and I would like to see some young blood in there. The idea that you can't do that when you are 20,21, especially when you're coming with the kind of resumes that these people have, is absolutely absurd. MARSHALL: I don't say anything about the age and I don't think -- I don't think at 20 -- DOMENECH: You just brought up the age twice. MARSHALL: -- yourself as big balls as one of these individuals has online and continues to. BAIER: OK. DOMENECH: I'm sorry, you brought up the age thing. I just think it has to be addressed. There are lots of people in their 20s who work in government on Capitol Hill and in these agencies who have access to all these different pieces of information. I think that this is naive, and I think it's out of touch. BAIER: Let me turn to Annie, and this is a follow up on the executive order from yesterday where we saw that image of President Trump with those young girls around him when he signed the executive order preventing males from participating in women and kids, girls sports. ESPN and the NCAA put out a statement that it is adjusting its transgender policy in the wake of the Trump executive order. I didn't know how this was going to play out. Obviously schools that receive federal funding, but the NCAA putting out its own statement on this, Annie. LINSKEY: You know, Bret, I was in the East Room yesterday when the president signed that executive order. And it was packed. It was a crowded event. There was so much energy in that room. And this is really, if you look at the polling, vast majority of Americans agree with the president's position here. I have to say even when he was talking about the executive order, he kept on saying I'm surprised I even have to do this. This is something that I wouldn't have expected I would have had to do. And he was sort evincing a lot of confusion about why it would be necessary to sign this order. So it was a big event for him. It's an issue that I think he came into office -- he campaigned on this issue. So it's really should be no surprise. And you are seeing, you know, what Karoline Leavitt called the Trump effect, where there are groups that are following into line and following his leadership, particularly on this issue. BAIER: Yes. That image, that video, really something to look at in the big picture. Panel, thanks so much. Finally tonight, a special day. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GAYLE BENSON, OWNER, NEW ORLEANS SAINTS: This moment is more than just a stunning display of lights, music and color. It is a tribute to the rich beauty, history, and resilience of our beloved city. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: New Orleans Saints owner Gayle Benson and the NFL organizing a dazzling light show hosted by the historic St. Louis Cathedral. First of its kind event illuminates the city's Jackson Square on each day leading up to the Super Bowl, shows celebrating the big game as well as the unique spirit of New Orleans. It's going to be something. Also Sunday, you can watch my exclusive sit-down interview with President Trump on FOX during the pregame coverage of the Super Bowl. Tomorrow on SPECIAL REPORT, GOP senators head to Mar-a-Lago to meet with President Trump ahead of a national senatorial committee retreat.

JOSH SHAPIRO (D-PA): That's what Phil said. It must be true. Welcome to Punxsutawney. DEAN: Listen, I have done this many years. I didn't think I could find someone more excited than me, but it might be you. SHAPIRO: Oh, my God. You and I are like 1 in 1A. This is unbelievable. 50,000 people from all across Pennsylvania, the country, the world, coming to Punxsutawney to find out what our official state meteorologist has to say about -- DEAN: I can't believe he's right next to us right now. He looks like he wants to get out of there. SHAPIRO: He's like royalty, by the way. DEAN: Oh, he is. I got to talk about your tweet about PETA. SHAPIRO: Oh, gosh. DEAN: Tell me what did -- why? What did you think? I think this is important. He is treated like a king. SHAPIRO: He is treated like a king. By the way, I'm the governor of Pennsylvania. I got to tell you. Phil's got better healthcare than I do. The inner circle treats him great. DEAN: Yes. SHAPIRO: And I got to say, I think it's disrespectful what they said about this amazing tradition. DEAN: Yes. SHAPIRO: Get 50,000 people from all different walks of life coming together to be joyful, to celebrate, to appreciate a tradition. By the way, it started in the 1880s right here in Pennsylvania.

DEAN: So, listen, I have to say condolences for the losses that we had in Philadelphia. What can you say? It's a bittersweet moment. SHAPIRO: Yes. I mean, look, today, we're celebrating with such joy, but just, you know, miles away in Northeast Philly, there's been a lot of pain and anguish. We continue to try and lift everyone up in the community in prayer. We saw a tragic aviation accident, but we also saw just neighbors doing wonderful things to look out for one another. That's the Northeast Philly way. That's the Pennsylvania way. I've spent a lot of time over the last 48 hours in Northeast Philly. I'm heading back there and we're going to continue to lift up the community. DEAN: I'm glad you came today though, because one thing is for sure, it doesn't matter who you voted for, it doesn't matter what you look like, how much money you make, to come here and celebrate, it's really -- you can't describe it. SHAPIRO: You can, and that's the joy of this place. You got people from all different walks of life. As you said, people with different political persuasion, whatever, but everybody is here together to be together and to enjoy this great tradition. DEAN: One more question. You know, I'm in the forecasting business, so I forecast weather. In the political world, what might you be doing in four years? SHAPIRO: You know what I'm going to be doing in four years? I'll be right here in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. DEAN: That's a really good answer. Thanks for coming on Fox & Friends. SHAPIRO: Great to be with you. Thank you. DEAN: All right.

Entire first term, just 11 days. Just 11 days Donald Trump had a net positive approval rating. Compare that to the second term, just so far, just so far. Every single day of Trump's second term, so far, he has been on the positive side of the ledger, a different world. That is what's going on right now. We're living in a different world. 70 percent of Americans say Trump is doing what he promised to do. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: Breaking tonight, the numbers are in, and it is now a different world as a majority of Americans now approve of the job that President Trump is doing, and that's likely because he is doing what he said he would do.

ASHLEY STROHMIER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Trace. A big reason for President Trump's record high approval rating is because, as CBS notes, he is delivering on many of his campaign promises, much of that being done through the more than 60 executive orders he's issued so far. Just today, Trump signed orders eliminating the Federal Executive Institute, a management training program for career civil servants, and then mandating the government used plastic straws, a reversal of the Biden administration policy. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TRUMP: We're going back to plastic straws. These things don't work. I've had them many times, and on occasion they break, they explode. STROHMIER (voice over): And it's not just polls showing how popular Trump is at this stage in his presidency. Take a look at how he was received at last night's Super Bowl. STROHMIER: You'd love to see it in whether it's an order supporting plastic straws or being the first sitting president to ever attend the Super Bowl, which is baffling to me, but Trump seems to be making changes in so many facets of American life and in the federal government, with the help of the Department of Government Efficiency and Elon Musk. TRUMP: I'm going to tell him very soon, like maybe in 24 hours, to go check the Department of Education. Then I'm going to go to the military. Let's check the military. We're going to find billions, hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud and abuse. (END VIDEOTAPE) STROHMIER (on camera): But Trace, of course, none of this is without resistance. A judge today continued to block the Trump administration's buyout offer to over two million federal civilian employees, and around 65,000 federal employees have reportedly accepted the offer, and Musk said today that $59 million was spent to house illegal migrants in luxury New York City hotels. Back to you. GALLAGHER: We're going to talk a lot more about that. Ashley Strohmier live for us in New York. Ashley, thank you. Let's bring in Fox News political analyst Gianno Caldwell and Fox News Contributor Jason Chaffetz. Gentlemen, welcome to both of you. I want to -- Jason, to you first. Give you a quick sample of DOGE's to do list. This is FoxNews.com quoting, the Department of Health and Human Services canceled more than 180 million in contracts over 48 hours, including a nearly 170,000 contract for an Anthony Fauci museum exhibit. DOGE X post, also today, the Department of Education terminated 89 contracts worth 881 million, one contractor was paid 1.5 mil to observe mailing and clerical operations at a mall center. Final, DOGE post, today, the Department of Education terminated 29 DEI training grants totaling $101 million. Pretty good days work, Jason. JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, the numbers are absolutely stunning. I mean, what in the world is the Health and Human Services even doing with having a museum, but to celebrate and have an exhibit on Doctor Fauci? Are you kidding me? Look, I am so glad that the country is so grateful. This is why Donald Trump's ratings are off the charts. He's doing exactly what he was going to said he was going to do. We're only three weeks into this administration, and Elon Musk and whoever those people that he brought in, are able to look at things. Look, I was the chairman of the Oversight Committee, I couldn't go see that specificity. How he did it? More power to him. It's exactly what the country needs. GALLAGHER: Man, I'll tell you that. Gianno, to you now. Some reaction to CBS poll numbers, new poll numbers on Trump's job approval. Let's watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Our CBS poll finds that a majority of Americans, 53 percent approve of the job he's doing. That's a better approval number than he ever reached during his first term in the White House. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He is doing in the eyes of the public what he said he would do in the campaign. There's political value in that. In fact, 70 percent of people say he's doing what he promised. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: And you know, it just pains CBS to say these things. GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes, 70 percent of Americans believe that Donald Trump is doing exactly what he campaigned to do. How can I disagree with him? How can I disagree with Jason on this very point? The truth of the matter is the American people wanted to have inflation stop. They wanted to have illegal immigration at the border stop. They wanted to ensure that there was safety and security. And President Donald Trump is doing exactly that. He's installing Cabinet members like Pam Bondi, Attorney General of the United States, who's doing what he has instructed. Many others are doing exactly that. So, the thanks, I think, belongs to those in which he's appointed to these particular positions who are doing exactly what the American people want them to do. GALLAGHER: Quick back and forth. This is Bret Baier and Donald Trump talking about the -- you know, J.D. Vance being the heir apparent. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Right now, do you view Vice President J.D. Vance as your successor, the Republican nominee in 2028? TRUMP: No, but he's very capable. I mean, I don't think that it -- you know, I think you have a lot of very capable people. So far, I think he's doing a fantastic job. It's too early. We're just starting. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: I thought the answer Jason would be yes. Are you surprised at all? CHAFFETZ: No. I mean, look, we're three weeks into the Trump administration tTo talk about a successor. You got to be able to take the reins at any given moment. And I think J.D. Vance exemplifies, personifies, exactly the type of personality that's new and is leading the Republican Party. He's young, he's vibrant, he understands the numbers. He represents the values of this country. He pulled himself up from the bootstraps. It's the all American story. But I think he enjoys Donald Trump's full throttle support. GALLAGHER: Yes, he does. Lastly, Gianno, I want to talk about the upcoming Caldwell Institute gala at Mar-a-Lago here. I want to read the following inspired by Gianno's personal loss, talking, of course, about your brother. The inaugural gala unites us to celebrate justice and honor those who stand for victims' rights across the nation. You say we are honored to welcome John Walsh, host of ""AMERICA'S MOST WANTED"", as our keynote speaker. It's a noteworthy cause, very important, Gianno. Give me -- give me 15, 30 seconds on this. CALDWELL: Absolutely and I'm thankful that we're having the Caldwell Institute for Public Safety gala at Mar-a-Lago on February 22nd, people can get their tickets at CaldwellInstitute.Org. We welcome everyone who believes in justice. Certainly. So thankful that we have this moment where we can have John Walsh, who's a crime fighter. We have Lisa Boothe, who's going to be our emcee, and certainly we have the American people who have been supportive of our efforts of taking down George Soros funded progressive prosecutors. Please support us at CaldwellInstitute.Org. GALLAGHER: Yes, it's a good cause. Gianno, Jayson, thank you both. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANA NAVARRO, ""THE VIEW"" CO-HOST: I think today, Donald Trump is going to sign an executive order banning Black people from halftime. And all the racists who somehow get in. Man, were they hopping mad. So, if the racist are mad, I am happy as a clam. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: Donald Trump was loudly cheered, sought out by Kansas City Chief star for a handshake, and posed for a photo op with Patrick Mahomes' brother, all while making history as the first sitting president to attend a Super Bowl. Let's bring in political strategist and podcast host Tiffany Marie Brannon, along with Steamboat Institute Bankley fellow Amber Duke. Thank you both, and welcome for coming. I mean, the Ana Navarro comment there, Tiffany, was really one of those things where she said it's a joke, but when you say it over and over again, it's not really a joke, it's kind of a pattern, right? It's kind of a -- TIFFANY MARIE BRANNON, POLITICAL STRATEGIST: Yes, it's no different than the calling Trump Hitler comments that we've gotten for the last, you know, decade, almost at this point. And really, you look at the numbers, Trump's approval rating with Black voters is only climbing. It's only getting better. And if anyone can prove that Donald Trump is a man who very much is a part of the American Black community, just look at what we've been seeing in terms of the voters who are turning out to support him. GALLAGHER: Yes, we just talked about the numbers for the past several minutes here. Here's the video at the Super Bowl, but he's talking about this. This is, of course, Donald Trump and Taylor Swift in little contrast here. Watch this. I mean, Taylor Swift ever clearly has a history with the Philadelphia fan series. There's a little bit of that in there, they were taking a dig. But it's interesting, nonetheless, the cheers and the boos. AMBER DUKE, STEAMBOAT INSTITUTE BANKLEY FELLOW: Absolutely. I mean, she's been booed at a couple of Kansas City Chiefs games as well. And Trump has only been getting more popular, especially among sports fans and athletes. We saw tons of high profile athletes doing the Trump dance over the past year, and this is a cultural vibe shift. This is a sea change moment that we all got to watch during the Super Bowl, and Taylor Swift looks so shocked. Well, sorry, Taylor. This isn't the Eras Tour. This is an arena full of sports fans, and these are exactly the type of people who were not persuaded by your Instagram message urging people to vote for Kamala Harris, and not to mention the fact that those approval rating numbers Trump up 10 points with Gen Z. GALLAGHER: Yes. Mark Halperin said this. He said this before the Super Bowl. If you listen to it, it sounds to me like he is kind of comparing Democrats to how the Kansas City Chiefs played last night. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARK HALPERIN, JOURNALIST: I'm paid to not be baffled or speechless. That's been my job. I am baffled and somewhat speechless. The Democrats are nowhere on the field. The press is nowhere on the field. I have never seen anything like not just the activity, but the -- but the inability of his opponents to forget stopping him. They're barely, with a few exceptions, even slowing him down. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: I mean, it really does sound like a Super Bowl analogy there, and they're having trouble slowing Trump down. BRANNON: That's the beauty of this administration, is that they came in with the plan. They had over thousand pre-approved administration members, and they're coming in hard, and they're coming in fast. A lot of my friends are saying it's like trying to drink water from a fire hose right now. And that's kind of the feeling across the board. So, you see that last night the game, and you're seeing it right now in politics. GALLAGHER: Yes, really, it's one of those things where you watch these boxing matches. I'm a big boxing fan, and when you see some fighter get stunned, they just don't know really how to respond. That's kind of happening right now. Lastly, the Hill writes the following here, quoting, Senate Democrats launch a portal for whistle blowers in the Trump administration. It's interesting because, Amber, a lot of the comments that they got on this are the ones saying, Democrats are the ones that need the whistle blowers, not one that whistle on the Trump administration. DOGE is really kind of outing, right, they're the whistleblower for the Trump administration. DUKE: That's right. And I wish that the Democrats had paid attention to the IRS whistleblowers who said that they were stopped from investigating potential leads that would have gone to President Joe Biden's alleged foreign corruption, but I guess they only discover whistleblowers now that they're desperate to stop Trump. As Tiffany said, Trump is employing a flood the zone strategy, and Democrats are so desperate. They don't know how to respond to it. They were caught completely flat footed by this aggressive strategy. I think it was one of the smartest things Trump could have done. GALLAGHER: It's amazing they're talking about whistleblowers. They're talking about impeachment already 21 days in. It really is something out of the playbook of 2017, 2018, but here we are again. Tiffany, Amber, thank you both. Well, along with U.S. troops deploying to the southern border. It sounds like the Trump administration plans to send some IRS agents to help in the fight against illegal immigration. Bill Melugin is live with the new information on the new move. Bill, good evening. BILL MELUGIN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Trace, good evening to you. The full on blitz continues. The Trump administration now looking to deputize IRS agents to help ICE out with arresting and deporting illegal aliens. Take a look at this in a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem writes, in part, ""It is DHS's understanding that the Department of the Treasury has qualified law enforcement personnel available to assist with immigration enforcement, especially in light of recent increases to the Internal Revenue Services's workforce and budget. This letter requests that you make qualified officials from the Department of the Treasury available to work with ICE and that you consent to those officials being deputized to perform immigration functions."" Now, in the meantime, deportation flights to Venezuela have restarted again today, with Trump's envoy for special missions, Ric Grenell, supervising two flights of Venezuelans being sent back to Venezuela from El Paso. Flights also continue to Guantanamo Bay, that's where Secretary Noem recently visited. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KRISTI NOEM, HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: I watched a plane load of people unload at Gitmo that were pedophiles, child pornographers. They were drug dealers in our communities that literally, these cartels are partnering with the Chinese to kill our next generation of Americans. That's who we're putting down there at Gitmo, and I'm just so thankful that they're not in our country anymore. (END VIDEO CLIP) MELUGIN: More U.S. troops are also headed to the southern border as well, with DOD announcing another 1500 active duty troops, which will be deployed in the coming days. That brings the total to roughly 3600 troops working at our southern border. And Trace, illegal crossings have fallen off cliff. Excuse me, microscopic numbers. If you sent us down there right now, we'd have trouble finding anybody. GALLAGHER: Yes, well, we might send you down there right now. Bill, thanks. Bill Melugin, we appreciate it. Well, the FOX NEWS @ NIGHT Common Sense Department couldn't help but notice that Elon Musk is claiming FEMA sent $59 million last week to pay luxury hotels in New York City to house illegal immigrants. Elon says his Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE just found out about the money and is planning to claw it back. But New York City officials are claiming it's nowhere near 59 million and that it's from a ""previously allocated reimbursement."" It's like Butch Cassidy saying, the stolen money in his pocket is not stolen. It was previously allocated by the bank. Again, Common Sense doesn't care what program or grant or bucket FEMA got the money. It's federal money. Federal money should not be used to support those who broke federal law. It's a federal violation. Maybe that's why DHS Secretary Kristi Noem says we should, ""Get rid of FEMA the way it exists today"", because today's FEMA appears to lack a sense of urgency, yet embraces a sense of bias. Remember, this is the same FEMA that told FOX NEWS @ NIGHT that after Hurricane Milton in Florida, FEMA avoided homes with Trump signs. Common Sense has one small suggestion for FEMA, read the room. It's bad enough that you deliberately ignored homes with signs for Trump. Now you are deliberately ignoring executive actions signed by Trump. Let's bring in former Pinal CountyArizona Sheriff, Mark Lamb. Sheriff, great to have you on the show as always. Elon Musk is correct. The government should not be sending $59 million of federal money to take care of those who broke federal law. MARK LAMB., FORMER PINAL COUNTY ARIZONA SHERIFF: He's absolutely correct. And that number is actually about 650 million through the shelter and Services Program, which goes to FEMA through DHS, the majority of that money, as we know, have been used on those who came into this country illegally, for hotels and all sorts of other stuff. Meanwhile, we have people in North Carolina that are continuing to go without, as we do in Lahaina, Hawaii or Maui. We've also got the people in California. That's where that money should have gone. That's what Americans think that money is going to when they pay their taxes. GALLAGHER: Yes. Meantime, a week ago, Trump threatened tariffs against Mexico. You know, the left maligned him, saying nothing is going to come with this. Mexico agreed to send reinforcements to the border. The Washington Examiner now writes the following, quoting here, Trump's request for Mexico to enhance border security already paying dividends. It goes on to say, four days after its implementation, authorities arrested 139 people and seized over eight kilograms of fentanyl, according to reports, dozens of firearms and numerous other drugs also seized as part of the operation, including cocaine, heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine. I mean, the Trump push for these tariffs and subsequent deal is already saving lives, and that's the important thing, Sheriff. LAMB: Absolutely, I don't want to forget -- I want any of our American people to forget that we've been losing over 100,000 people a year to fentanyl, not to mention methamphetamines, heroin, cocaine, all the other drugs that have been coming across with virtually no stoppage at all from the previous administration. And now that President Trump is actually meaning what he says and saying what he means, the Mexican government is actually taking him seriously, and they are mobilizing as well. And we're seeing those positive effects already. We got a lot of work to still do, but we're going in the right direction. GALLAGHER: Yes. Meantime, the Daily Mail writes the following here. President Donald Trump wants to send IRS agents to the Mexico border to remove illegal migrants, the tax agents would be deputized to help arrest, detain and transport people out of the country. Interesting, because you're getting IRS, is this like to audit? No, it's not to audit. It's to arrest. What do you think of that plan? LAMB: Well, look, I think it's great because now they're not bothering the American people, but I actually have a friend who's a treasury agent. And they do a lot of great work. And I think what they're meaning is those treasury agents that have been trained, they've gone through, you know, law enforcement academies, they putting cases together, serving warrants. And I think a lot of those guys are who they're referring to. They can take them, put them on the border to help and assist with securing our border. GALLAGHER: Sheriff Mark Lamb, former Sheriff Mark Lamb, great to have you on the show as always. We appreciate it. Sir, thank you. LAMB: Good to see you. GALLAGHER: And coming up, we have breaking information about a plane collision in Scottsdale, Arizona. The update on that is next. And breaking tonight, one of President Trump's most controversial Cabinet nominees clears a key Senate hurdle. We'll talk about that. And later in the Nightcap. Donald Trump getting a massive cheer at yesterday's Super Bowl, while mega pop star Taylor Swift got booed a bit, as you heard. Many are saying it's emblematic of a culture shift as President Trump begins his second term, what do you think? Culture shift? Just football fans being football fans? Let us know X and Instagram @TraceGallagher, we'll read your responses coming up in the Nightcap. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GALLAGHER: Here's some breaking news coming into FOX NEWS @ NIGHT, at least one person was killed, three others injured when two private jets collided at Scottsdale airport in Arizona. The FAA says one of the planes veered off the runway and then collided with the second plane, which was parked on private property. Unknown exactly how that happened, but the owner of the jet that veered off the runway, reportedly is the lead singer of the band Motley Crue, Vince Neil. We have zero information indicating that Vince Neil was on board that plane. It is believed the landing gear of that plane failed, and we will bring you new information as it comes in to FOX NEWS @ NIGHT. Well, one of the president's most polarizing Cabinet nominees passed a major hurdle tonight, setting up a full confirmation vote this week for Tulsi Gabbard as the Director of National Intelligence. Mark Meredith is live for us in D.C., with the breaking information on this. Mark, good evening. MARK MEREDITH, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Trace, good evening to you. Tonight, the Senate voted down party lines to advance Tulsi Gabbard nomination to be the Director of National Intelligence, which means a final confirmation vote is only hours away. Gabbard is considered one of the more controversial nominees of Trump's second term, and while she's a military veteran, some lawmakers have been outraged over her past support for government leaker Edward Snowden. She wants push for charges against Snowden to be dropped, even after he leaves classified data about a mass surveillance program to the media. Gabbard says she's eager to shake up the intelligence community. Top Republicans say they believe an outsider can take over. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JOHN THUNE (R-SD): I'm glad that Ms. Gabbard plans to focus on identifying and eliminating redundancies and inefficiencies to restore the office to what it was originally designed to be. MEREDITH (voice over): It wasn't long ago, Gabbard was a registered Democrat. She even ran as the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate. Now, Democratic Senator Mark Warner is among those very critical of her nomination. SEN. MARK WARNER (D-VA): A vote in favor of her confirmation is an endorsement of President Trump's lawless efforts to hollow out our national security workforce, and her confirmation will further strain the alliances that are kept our country safe for decades. (END VIDEO CLIP) MEREDITH: Following Gabbard's confirmation vote, the Senate expected to begin efforts to confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr., he's up for the Secretary of Health and Human Services. But you got a lot of nominees, Trace that are still waiting confirmation. You got people in key positions, like Trump's pick to lead the Department of Commerce, still waiting for the final vote, Trace. GALLAGHER: A lot of waiting. Mark Meredith live for us in D.C. Mark, thank you. Let's bring in former FBI special agent and Fox News Contributor Nicole Parker, along with political strategist Joey Mannarino, thank you both for coming on. Nicole, to you first. Democratic Senator Mark Warner, and Mark Meredith played a little bit of that. I want to play a little bit more because it's important to the next question. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MARK WARNER (D-VA): Ms. Gabbard has celebrated Snowden as a ""brave whistleblower."" She blamed NATO for Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Ms. Gabbard exercised terrible, terrible judgment and had to meet with Bashar al-Assad, and in her confirmation hearing, she seemed unable to recognize why the national security interest of the United States might be better protected if TikTok, a social media app that reached into homes of millions of Americans was actually under America ownership. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: I think the important news here is that, the context is taken out of all of those things. There are just kind of headlines and bullet points that don't really have any effect. Do you think they are valid concerns, Nicole? NICOLE PARKER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I had the privilege and opportunity to testify before Congress alongside Tulsi Gabbard about two years ago, and what I can say is Ms. Gabbard is a true patriot. She has served our country for over 22 years. And when I had the opportunity to meet her, she literally emanates and exudes light and strength. She is a woman of integrity, and I believe that she will do amazing things for our intelligence community. And I think that President Trump is right on task as he is nominating individuals. These are very unconventional, non-status quo picks. That is what America wants. That is what they have voted for and that is what they are going to get. I think that she is vivacious, she is vibrant, and I think that she will do a fantastic job and I do believe that she will be approved. GALLAGHER: Meantime, Joey, here's Politico trying to kind of gin up a little maybe edge of your seat politics. They go on to say here the headline telling Gabbard Trump's terrifying troika, Patel has a vengeful nature, they say, when a reporter from the Atlantic sought to give. Wait, no, no, no. Take that back. Take that back. Take that back. Here we go. It says, ""Vance out of the country ahead of Gabbard confirmation,"" but will say the next one. ""If three Republicans oppose Gabbard and no Democrats support her as expected, she will need Vance to break a tie to help her get over the finish line."" It sounds like she's going to be fine without J.D. Vance, Joey. What do you think? They're just kind of like, let's get this thing some excitement in here? JOEY MANNARINO, POLITICAL STRATEGIST: Yes, she'll be just fine. So, Susan Collins came out today, and she said that she will be supporting Lisa Murkowski came out and said that she'll be supporting, so you have those two. I really don't understand why Bernie Sanders is not supporting this woman after she stepped down when she was in the DNC. She stepped down to protest how they treated him. He can't seem to come to terms with actually giving himself the decency to return the favor, but whatever. We're going to be fine without J.D. Vance. He can stay in France and enjoy his time over there learning from whatever craziness the E.U. is talking about now and we will be just fine. Tulsi Gabbard will be confirmed. We will get what we voted for, and J.D. can enjoy his trip. GALLAGHER: Yes, we will see it. I think a lot of people have that consensus. Meantime, I gave you a little preview, Nicole, but here we go again. The Hill, they were writing about this. It's interesting because they call RFK Jr., the anti-vaxxer -- he's not. Calls Tulsi Gabbard woefully ignorant, not. Said this about Kash Patel, quoting here, put this on the screen, ""Patel has a vengeful nature when a reporter from the Atlantic sought to interview many of the nearly 40 of Patel's former colleagues fearing certain retaliation they said they would only do so if they could remain anonymous."" Yes, they're just petrified of Kash Patel coming back on him. What do you think, Nicole? PARKER: As a former FBI Special Agent who walked away from the FBI because it had been politically and socially weaponized, it will be a breath of fresh air to have someone get in there and to make some real changes. You know, I consider it a form of disruptive innovation. And I think that's exactly what the federal government needs. It's exactly what the FBI needs right now. Because what is going on right now is not working. You know, with Director Wray, Director Comey, Director Mueller, you know, Kash Patel is different. He is unique. And I think what he brings to the table is exactly what President Trump wants, and I am confident that he will lead the FBI with strength. GALLAGHER: And I'm curious about your take on this, Joey, because you talked about Tulsi Gabbard. So, now you have RFK, Jr., and you have Kash Patel in this mix. What do you think about both of their pushes? Do they get through? MANNARINO: I think they're going to get through. The bottom line is this, we have 53 Republican Senators. When Donald Trump won that mandate in November, it was for people like RFK, people like Tulsi Gabbard, people like Kash Patel. We said no more of the same old story that we have had for the past decades in Washington D.C. So, if these 53 Republican Senators can't get it together, they need to be nowhere near those seats because we voted for this. This is what Make America Great Again is about, and if they can't get with the program, it's time to pack it up and get out of there. GALLAGHER: Joey Mannarino, Nicole Parker, thank you both. And coming up, more on how President Trump is making America patriotic again, and a major vibe shift. Are we going to use that phrase? How about that? A vibe shift at the Super Bowl, showing the President may have more fans than Taylor Swift. That's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, U.S. PRESIDENT: I think just the spirit of the country, the country's taken on a whole new life. I thought it would be a good thing for the country to have the president be at the game. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: Well, there you have it, the president's historic appearance at Super Bowl LIX may have marked a real vibe shift in America. Let's bring in the host of the ""Emily Saves America"" podcast, Emily Wilson; conservative Gen-Z influencer and Barron Trump's best friend, Bo Loudon; along with conservative activist C.J. Pearson. Welcome to all of you. Emily, to you first. I mean, we played the sound a couple of times, the booing at over Taylor Swift at the game, and the cheering of Donald Trump. What do you think about that? I mean you know we have to explain that Taylor Swift used to be an Eagles fan, so there's a little bit of animosity there. But the truth of the matter is, you know, these are football fans and there was a little bit more going on there. What do you think about that? EMILY WILSON, PODCAST HOST: Yes, look, I don't think this is her crowd. I don't think people are going there for her. I think it's very widely known. People love Donald Trump. They're excited to see him. When he walks in places, people go nuts. And other than that, it's very simple. I'm sure there's a lot of people that didn't like her, but that's also what happens when you have a political opinion",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Bo, because I was at the game last night and you could kind of feel this change, right? And to me, you look around, and you watch the fans, and you know the Eagles fans were different because they were having a good night. But you look at the young fans, and even the Kansas City fans, the young people were kind of gravitating toward Trump -- really excited that he was there. It seems to be like you were right a couple months ago when you told us this, Bo, it seems to be this move toward the president, from young people's perspective. BO LOUDON, GEN-Z INTERNET PERSONALITY: A hundred percent, Trace. I mean, you know, when 56 percent of Gen-Z voters are voting for Donald Trump, male voters, we know that that he's sweeping Gen-Z in a landslide. And seeing things like the halftime show, you know, with Kentrick Lamar, it was OK, but it was nothing compared to the legendary halftime shows of the real American music legends like Travis Tritt and Kid Rock, you know. If that would have been there, the Super Bowl would have -- I mean, America would truly felt back. But it was still feeling like it's back because they said Taylor Swift was the real spearhead of the whole election. Her endorsement was going to sway the election. Well, I just watched her get booted by an entire stadium while our President Donald Trump got a standing ovation. So, it really does show that America's back and Gen Z is more on fire for Trump than ever. GALLAGHER: Yes, we lost C.J. Pearson. We're trying to get his shot back up. Meantime, let's go back to Emily, because I want to play some sound and this is kind of off the Super Bowl topic here, but I think it's interesting because it goes to the young people thing where Donald Trump was talking about paper straws versus plastic straws. And guess which one is in and guess which one is out. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is an executive order relating to the use of paper straws. As you've consistently identified, nobody really likes paper straws. TRUMP: These things don't work. I've had them many times, and on occasion they break, they explode. If we're going back to plastic straws, I think it's OK. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: I mean, it seems like it's this nominal, this innocuous little signing here, but, you know, a few years ago, Emily, the people in your generation would have thrown a fit; they would be out protesting this kind of stuff. WILSON: OK. I've been saying this forever, you go places, I'm paying like $12.00 for a latte. I get a paper straw. It tastes like paper. It's disgusting. And on top of that, you're telling me that the cup is plastic, the lid is plastic, but you're worried about the straw? It's ridiculous. This is incredible. GALLAGHER: Yes, it really is. Bo, to you, I want to put this. This is a USA Today opinion piece, and it reads as following here, final," this was: """"Super Bowl will now be called Trump America bowl moving forward."""" USA Today"," """"The Eagles' one last", one last ever Super Bowl. Next year," it will be the Trump America Bowl."""" The Trump America Bowl", what do you think about that? LOUDON: I think it sounds great. I think it has a great ring to it. And like you guys brought up the paper straws, we're getting rid of those. I think by the end of Trump's term, he's going to have the support of 90 percent of America. We've taken out things that really frustrate Americans like paper straws wrapped in plastic or our taxpayer dollars going to a bunch of bogus, bogus things, you know, with DOGE, it's over. I mean, Super Bowl, America, everybody watched our president last night and they could not be more on fire for him being our president. And everyone's saying, oh Trump supporters are regretting their votes. I don't regret my vote at all. I'm more proud and confident in that vote than I've been in pretty much anything in the last five years. So, I'm very happy to be having him back in office and I think all of America is as well. GALLAGHER: OK, I was going to give C.J. this question, but here's Emily. We're still looking for C.J. We can't get his shot back up. We've gone from players like kneeling during the National Anthem and now these players last night were emotional during the National Anthem and during America the Beautiful. And I want to play some sound, because this is Jalen Hurts and the head coach of the Eagles right after the game. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: God is good. He has it in the highs and the lows. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: God has blessed us very much. He gave us all the talents to be able to get here. So, first and foremost, thanks to him. Thank God. Thank you, Jesus. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All glory to God, first and foremost. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: It really is. It feels like a different time, Emily, right? Even if you're not a football fan, you think it's a different time. WILSON: Wow, that was four, thank you God, and God is back. That's wow, I'm impressed. That was like something that was like the forbidden thing to say. You could have mentioned God, religion, loving America, being thankful. I mean, yes, now we actually get to express our gratitude for this country, and we should, no matter what. GALLAGHER: Yes, and the whole thing was you look at that as a kind of a vibe change right, Bo to steal a phrase, a vibe change and you see that kind of thing you see these people, these players that are that are getting emotional at the national anthem. And, and you know, kind of referring to God, again and again, what, what are your final thoughts on that? LOUDON: I mean, I think it's absolutely beautiful and it's everything that American needs right now. You know, we have, we have a crippled economy that Trump had to take from Biden and fix. We have a broken family unit in this country. We have terrible policy. And President Trump is coming here and fixing it all. And I couldn't be more happy to see it. I love that we have our generation that can look up to these football players that are, that are focused on God, and family, and country -- and not all of this degenerate woke stuff that they've been trying to shove in our brains for the past four years. GALLAGHER: And look at C.J. Pearson decided to pay us a visit. C.J., I want to -- no, we just, we lost him again. Put him up on the screen. We just want to see him because he just -- C.J., if you can talk, if you can hear us, I want to know your just your final thoughts on the whole vibe shift. And we lost him again, his shot again. So, there you go. Let's play this. I want to play this because I didn't get a chance to see it, and a lot of people did and this is the Fox, Fox News commercial that played during the first quarter and again in the second half. Watch this. Big giant tribute to what a busy news year it is, the changing world, and you know a toast to FOX NEWS @ NIGHT. Thank you all for that, we appreciate it. Emily, C.J., if you can hear us, we appreciate that. Bo Loudon, thank you as well. Meantime, President Trump received a massive cheer at yesterday's Super Bowl, while Taylor Swift got negative reaction full of boos. Many say it's emblematic of the culture shift we just talked about with Trump 2.0. What do you think, culture shift or just a typical football game? Let us know, X and Instagram," @TraceGallagher. We're back with the """"NIGHTCAP"""" crew", including you," next.

MEREDITH: I think they were cheering for you, Trace. I think they, you were there at the game. So, I'm assuming they splashed you up between Trump and Taylor, and they showed Trace. GALLAGHER: Yes, one me. Ashley. STROHMIER: I just think people are really tired of having Taylor Swift shoved down their throats every chance they get. GALLAGHER: Yes, I think that's fair. Bill Melugin. MELUGIN: I don't know what kind of reception she expected. She endorsed Kamala. Trump won Pennsylvania and Missouri, and like she just said, NFL fans are sick of seeing the camera on her every second every game. GALLAGHER: Yes, I think that's true. Tiffany. BRANNON: Yes. I think we're finally in the era where we're tired of a pop star telling us our political opinions.

Have a great night and a great weekend, and don't try that at home. SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening. Welcome to Washington. I'm Shannon Bream for Bret Baier. Breaking tonight, immigration authorities and Justice Department officials announcing the arrests of dozens of Tren de Aragua members. About 70 suspects were arrested in just the last 48 hours across the country. It comes as the DOJ appears in court for a legal battle over deportation flights to El Salvador with suspected gang members on board. We've got Fox team coverage tonight. Peter Doocy is at the White House with reaction from President Trump. David Spunt following the legal fight from the U.S. District Court here in Washington. But we begin with correspondent Bill Melugin in Los Angeles. He's going to tell us where the latest round of all the suspects were arrested. Hello, Bill. BILL MELUGIN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Shannon, good evening to you. The acting ICE Director announced today that just in the last 48 hours alone, ICE has arrested 68 suspected Tren de Aragua gang members, and he says the agency's goal is to completely eradicate that gang from U.S. soil. Now, one arrest is making some headlines, that one happened in the state of Florida. That's where ICE and state law enforcement announced that together, they made the first arrest in the entire nation of a TDA gang member via the Alien Enemies Act. He's a Venezuelan national who ICE says is involved in human trafficking. He was arrested not for his legal status or any alleged crimes, but the idea that he's a terrorist enemy of the United States under the statute from 1798. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TODD LYONS, ACTING ICE DIRECTOR: The president invoked the Alien Enemies Act, and our offices have risked their lives every day to ensure that we are going after these foreign terrorist networks in our communities. Our goal is to eradicate TDA from U.S. soil. (END VIDEO CLIP) MELUGIN: Now, the Feds also announced a joint operation with ICE Border Patrol and the FBI that netted 14 arrests of suspected TDA gang members in the Washington, D.C. area, all of whom are accused of being involved in ongoing criminal activity. And in Georgia, U.S. marshals say they arrested a fugitive high ranking TDA gang member who is wanted in Chicago on two counts of first degree murder. Listen to this. This is after he allegedly kidnapped three women and shot them all on the head in a Chicago alley, killing two of them. MELUGIN: Now, Shannon ISIS told us that they never even encountered Tren de Aragua inside the United States prior to the year 2022. They say the Biden administration's mass catch and release policies allowed hundreds of these men into the country. Now their goal is to find and deport every single one of them. We'll send it back to you. BREAM: Big job ahead. All right, Bill Melugin, thank you very much from the West Coast. And now on to the legal battle concerning those flights to El Salvador. Federal judge heard arguments today from both sides in that case. Correspondent David Spunt was in that courtroom and reports from the U.S. District courthouse in Washington. Good evening, David. DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Shannon, good evening to you. Minutes into the 80 minute hearing, Judge James Boasberg expressed frustration with the Department of Justice for not following his order to return flights full of suspected gang members from Venezuela to El Salvador and stop any future flights. He asked, point blank the DOJ -- the DOJ attorney today with why was this proclamation signed in the dark and then these people rushed on the planes. The only reason to do that is if you know it's a problem and you want to get them before suits are filed. Meaning, lawsuits with clear tension in his voice, Boasberg named by Republican and Democratic presidents judicial seats, said the government used, ""Intemperate and disrespectful language in the written briefs."" Saying he had never seen that tone in other DOJ filings. The judge said that the government wasn't being terribly forthcoming, but was determined to get to the bottom of whether there was deliberate defiance of his order. Administration lawyers repeatedly said they acted fully within the law, Shannon. The government has not formally confirmed President Trump has invoked the state's secret privilege, an executive move that would allow the government to withhold what it deems national security information to the courts. Federal lawyers say cabinet level discussions are ongoing. And last week, Boasberg ordered the planes full of those suspected gang members to be turned around from that planned trip to El Salvador, two of them, though already outside U.S. airspace, they landed in El Salvador. The government claims that those planes were in international airspace could not legally be returned to the U.S. And those suspected gang members now in a Salvadorian prison, officials removed them under the 1798 Act called the Alien Enemies Act that Bill mentioned, citing an invasion of the United States. A DOJ spokesperson tells Fox News that the DOJ continues to believe that the court's superfluous questioning of sensitive national security information is inappropriate judicial overreach. On Monday, an appeals court judge will hear arguments over this very issue, and late this afternoon, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced that he is opening up a criminal investigation involving the leak of classified information involving Tren de Aragua. He said it's a way of getting involved in trying to stop President Trump's agenda, Shannon. BREAM: All right. David Spunt at the courthouse. Thank you, David. So, President Trump says the suspected gang members deported to El Salvador went through a strong vetting process. Senior White House Correspondent Peter Doocy asked the president about the flights today. Good evening, Peter. PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Shannon and President Trump told us a couple different times he thinks these gang members are thugs who are focused on destroying people and their homes, and he says he won the election in 2024 at least in part, on a promise to get them out of the country. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We can't let a judge say that he wants -- he didn't run for president. DOOCY (voice over): The president continues arguing he's got the authority to deport alleged gang members, and Judge James Boasberg does not have the authority to stop him. TRUMP: And we just can't let that happen. It would be so bad for our country. DOOCY (voice over): The president is also claiming these alleged gang members are terrorists, in the same category as people vandalizing Tesla property nationwide. TRUMP: The people that finance it are, in my opinion, is just as big a trouble as the people that are setting the match and setting the fires. DOOCY (voice over): If Tesla vandals are arrested, the president suggests they could serve time in the prisons of El Salvador, which have become so recently famous for such lovely conditions. TRUMP: They could get 20 years in jail, and they'll get it. I'll tell you, there's going to be no leniency and there'll be no pardons. DOOCY (voice over): As the president and the Defense Secretary unveiled a new sixth generation fighter jet, the Boeing built F-47, so secret, this is all the Pentagon can show. TRUMP: I was wondering how much you're going to show, but they came in with that. You see a wheel in the front. That's about it. DOOCY (voice over): Elon Musk took DOGE to the DOD for an in person meeting, and DOD officials disputed New York Times reporting that he would be shown China war plans. SEAN PARNELL, CHIEF PENTAGON SPOKESMAN: On the record, that is completely fake. Elon Musk is just coming over here for a visit. DOOCY (voice over): Musk writes, I look forward to the prosecutions of those at the Pentagon who are leaking maliciously false information to the New York Times. They will be found. The president explains why Musk shouldn't know about U.S. military posture towards China anyway. TRUMP: I don't want to show that to anybody, but certainly you wouldn't show it to a businessman who is helping us so much. DOOCY (voice over): President Trump also appeared to learn in real time that rescued NASA astronauts didn't get overtime for all the extra time in orbit. DOOCY: They got $5.00 a day per day. For 286 days, that is $1,430 in extra pay. Is there anything the administration can do to get them -- to make them whole? TRUMP: Well, nobody's ever mentioned this to me. If I have to, I'll pay that of my own pocket. OK, I'll get it for them. I'll take care of that. I like that. (END VIDEOTAPE) DOOCY (on camera): And Elon Musk joined President Trump a few minutes ago on Marine One. He and the whole team are heading to Bedminster for tonight, ahead of a trip tomorrow to Philadelphia and the NCAA Wrestling Championship, Shannon. BREAM: I feel like the astronauts should get a little bit more than that on your calculations, but we'll see what happens. By the way, I know Peter on his way out of the White House this afternoon, you were able to ask the president a little bit more about those deportation flights. DOOCY: Yes, and President Trump has no regrets about the way that his administration has moved to get these alleged gang members out of the country. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DOOCY: If there was a flight tonight full of accused gang members and somebody called and said, Mr. President, I know that this is still being adjudicated, but we can get these guys down to El Salvador right now. Would you say that that's OK? TRUMP: I would say that I'd have the Secretary of State handle it, because I'm not really involved in that. (END VIDEO CLIP) DOOCY: It's unclear just exactly how eager Secretary of State Marco Rubio is to test this federal judge's will, Shannon. BREAM: All right. Peter Doocy at the White House. Thank you, Peter. Dozens of protesters who want to keep the Education Department intact, held what they called a study in outside the headquarters today. The group set up school desks with signs, teachers and students spoke at this small rally, voicing concerns over President Trump's efforts to close that federal agency. A man arrested, at least in part, over pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University appeared in immigration court today. It comes as Columbia University moves closer to getting some of its federal funding back after it was withheld by the Trump administration amid allegations it hasn't adequately managed anti-Semitism on campus. Correspondent Alexis McAdams reports on the agreement. Good evening, Alexis. ALEXIS MCADAMS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Shannon. Yes, negotiations are ongoing, but sources who are familiar with those negotiations that have been going on for days tell me that the Trump administration met all nine demands, or the Columbia met all nine demands from the Trump administration, so they're trying to get closer to that deal. But that does not mean that the Ivy League university is going to get a cent, I'm told, of this money back, as we know, they cut $400 million in federal funding. Is just the beginning. We're told, this is just preconditions for opening talks, as Columbia has agreed to ban masks for the purpose of concealing identity, empowering 36 campus police officers with new authority to arrest students and appoint a Senior Vice Provost with broad responsibility overseeing the Department of Middle East, South Asian and African studies as well as the Center for Palestine studies. The Trump administration cut federal funding from Columbia, saying the school failed to protect Jewish students. For now, a federal judge has ruled that Columbia cannot hand over any student records. Trump's demands that the school do more to protect Jewish students could upend higher education, signaling a broader crackdown. OK, the DOJ threatening to slash more federal funds from other schools who are closely watching, accusing dozens of universities of civil rights violations, many of them with massive endowments, including Harvard, which listen to this, Shannon, has nearly $52 billion and counting in their endowment. This comes after ICE agents arrested Columbia grad Mahmoud Khalil, the 30- year-old campus activist who is originally from Syria and has a green card, is accused of leading anti-Semitic protests. Khalil facing deportation, as authorities say he's a national security threat. He was briefly in court today, and there's a hearing scheduled for next month. Back out here live at Columbia, we can tell you that Mahmoud Khalil remains behind bars in Louisiana. He could be moved though, Shannon, to New Jersey at a new ICE detention facility since this is closer to where he was arrested. Khalil says he's a political prisoner and even calling for more protests even though he's behind bars, Shannon. BREAM: All right, Alexis McAdams in New York. Thank you, Alexis. So, stocks were up today after President Trump's comments that there would be flexibility on tariffs, the Dow gained 32, the S&P 500 was up five. NASDAQ rose 92. For the week, stocks were in the green. The Dow gained 1-1/5, the S&P 500 rose a half a percentage point. NASDAQ was up just barely, gaining almost one-fifth of a percentage points. Up next, a fire knocks out power, one of the world's busiest airports, we're going to take you there. But first, here's what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. Fox 2 in St. Louis, where the husband of former Congresswoman Cori Bush is indicted on fraud charges. Prosecutors allege he submitted false applications and was awarded more than $20,000 in pandemic relief related funds. Fox 45 in Baltimore, where the Maryland Transportation Authority responds to an NTSB report that found a lack of risk evaluations before the incident contributed to the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse last year. The Transportation Authority said today, the Dali container ship is solely to blame for the collapse. And this is live look at Denver from Fox 31, one of the big stories there tonight, the disappearance of Saturn's rings. Because the planet is tilted on its access, our view from Earth will be altered. Starting tomorrow, Saturn's rings will seem to disappear for a few days. For the next several months, they will look very thin. That's tonight's live look outside the Beltway from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BREAM: Some flights are now arriving again at London's Heathrow airport after a large electrical fire knocked out power overnight. Hundreds of thousands of travelers were forced to change their plans. Senior Foreign Affairs Correspondent Greg Palkot is at Heathrow now with much more about reports on the investigation into the outage. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GREG PALKOT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Heathrow getting back to business tonight, but there's a huge travel backlog to clear after Europe's busiest airport was shut down for much of the day. No takeoffs, no landings, no business. It was due to what was described as a significant fire at an electrical substation overnight nearby, which serves the airport. THOMAS WOLDBYE, HEATHROW AIRPORT CHIEF EXECUTIVE: This is unprecedented. It's never happened before, and that's why I'm saying it has been a major incident. PALKOT (voice over): The fire was eventually brought under control, but the blaze cut off power to Heathrow, suspending all operations. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We appreciate the restoration of power is our priority. PALKOT (voice over): The incident led to the cancelation of over 1300 flights, affecting more than 200,000 passengers. Many planes diverted, some sent back, some not taking off at all. Travelers around the world and London grounded. PALKOT: How do you feel? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How do you think I feel? Not great. PALKOT: Disgruntled. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I was ready to go home. PALKOT (voice over): There is currently no suspicion of foul play concerning the fire, but no cause has yet been found. U.K.'s counter terrorism detectives are leading the investigation due to what they call the impact on this critical piece of national infrastructure. Critics say today's events show Heathrow's backup systems and planning are lacking. Officials claim they're on it. ED MILIBAND, BRITISH ENERGY SECRETARY: We will want to understand both the causes of this event and what lessons, if any, it can teach us. PALKOT (voice over): After tonight's first few flights, Heathrow says it hopes to run a full schedule starting tomorrow. (END VIDEOTAPE) PALKOT (on camera): With Heathrow starting to get back to normal, officials say it will still take days to work out passenger travel disruptions, maybe much more than that, to learn some lessons, Shannon. BREAM: Yes, that ripple effect is going to be a monster. OK. Greg, thank you very much. We bring you a Fox News exclusive tonight on the return of an American who was detained by the Taliban for more than two years. George Glezmann is back on U.S. soil. His wife and another former Taliban hostage were there to greet him at Joint Base Andrews. Chief Washington correspondent Mike Emanuel reports on the emotional homecoming. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): After more than two years in Taliban captivity, American George Glassman is back in the United States. GEORGE GLEZMANN, RELEASED DETAINEE: I feel like born again. EMANUEL (voice over): After landing today at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington, D.C. GLEZMANN: I'm just thankful, I got no words to express my gratitude for my liberty, my freedom. EMANUEL (voice over): Glezmann expressed his gratitude to President Trump and his administration. GLEZMANN: Thanks to President Trump, to Marco Rubio, to all these people that made possible my liberty, my freedom. EMANUEL (voice over): Glezmann had an emotional reunion with his wife, Aleksandra. Glezmann was a Delta Airlines mechanic who was detained while visiting Afghanistan as a tourist in December 2022. He was never charged with a crime. GLEZMANN: Half a day into my trip into Afghanistan, the Taliban blocked me because there's no other way, abducted me in the streets of Kabul and threw me into a dungeon with no windows, no nothing. EMANUEL (voice over): At least 24 unjustly detained Americans have been released since President Trump returned to the White House, two with help from the Biden administration. President Trump's special envoy for hostage affairs, Adam Boehler, suggests there's more to come. ADAM BOEHLER, HOSTAGE ENVOY: The Taliban understand that there's a new sheriff in town, that President Trump is that new sheriff, and that's why you're seeing something like this. And I expect to see more. EMANUEL (voice over): For this American, the nightmare is over. (END VIDEOTAPE) EMANUEL (on camera): The State Department is still pressing for the return of six American detainees in Afghanistan and the remains of one U.S. citizen. U.S. officials thanked Qatar for its help, as it maintains close ties with the Taliban, Shannon. BREAM: Such a relief. I'm sure to his family and his loved ones. EMANUEL: Amen. BREAM: Great story. Thank you, Mike. EMANUEL: Thank you. BREAM: So, up next, Democrats work to change their messaging and why some voters don't appear to be buying it. Just some of this stories Beyond our Border tonight, we'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BREAM: Democratic lawmakers holding town halls in Republican districts are not getting the response from voters that they were hoping for. It comes as some in the party appear to be on different pages regarding the party's playbook. Senior National Correspondent Aishah Hasnie reports as Democrats consider how to rebrand. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) AISHAH HASNIE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Tonight, Democrats are licking their wounds after a dressing down from their base. Furious voters showing up at town halls across the country this week to demand their elected officials fight back harder against President Trump. Their rage exacerbated by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer caving to the GOP. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I got asked you one last time about Chuck Schumer. SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT): No. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You can't -- HASNIE (voice over): While progressives dodge questions about Schumer's future, they are mobilizing that anger for 2026. REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): I want you to look at every level of office around and support brawlers who fight because those are the ones who can actually win against Republicans. HASNIE (voice over): Swing state Democrats, though, question the strategy. SEN. ELISSA SLOTKIN (D-MI): I can't do what she does, because we live in a purple state and I'm a pragmatist. I got to say things for my people. HASNIE (voice over): Democrats are also trying to win back young male voters. Former Vice Presidential candidate Tim Walz at the forefront, claiming his masculinity scares MAGA and -- GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MN): I can kick most of their ass. HASNIE (voice over): President Trump punching back today. TRUMP: Well, he's a loser. HASNIE (voice over): While the Democrats town halls look like the Tea Party movement of 2009 and 2010, Republicans don't expect a midterm massacre. But conservative group Club for Growth is urging them to hold in-person town halls despite the House Republican campaign arm advising them not to and instead go virtual. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you know what DOGE is doing? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, I know what DOGE is doing and no, I'm not scared. DAVID MCINTOSH, CLUB FOR GROWTH PRESIDENT: Our ideas win, and when we are out there fighting for them, we're going to win elections.

Shannon, as Democrats are trying to find their way, get this, President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden are now pitching themselves to the DNC to help fundraise for the Dems, really do anything to helping them regroup. One former Democrat aid told ""The New York Post"" this is an ""SNL"" skit, while President Trump said in jest he hopes it happens. Shannon? BREAM: We'll watch and see if it does. Aishah Hasnie, thank you very much. There are questions tonight over money designated for green energy projects during the Biden administration. Billions from the Inflation Reduction Act went to an investment group being criticized as a slush fund for leftwing groups. Senior national correspondent Rich Edson looks at who got some of that funding. Good evening, Rich. RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS STATE DEPARTMENT CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Shannon. It's all part of a multibillion dollars legal fight over a major piece of the Biden administration's legacy, a $20 billion fund designed to leverage private investments in clean energy. The Trump administration is trying to freeze the Greenhouse Gas Reduction fund and requested an investigation into its spending, claiming that, quote, ""Recent findings reveal a pattern of reckless financial management, blatant conflicts of interest, astonishing sums of tax dollars awarded to unqualified recipients, and severe deficiencies in regulatory oversight under the private administration."" President Trump called one of its grants, quote, ""appalling waste."" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: $1.9 billion to recently created decarbonization of homes committee headed up, and we know she is involved, just at the last moment, the money was passed over, by a woman named Stacey Abrams. Have you ever heard of her? (BOOS) (END VIDEO CLIP) EDSON: So that grant went to Power Forward. It's a coalition of five energy organizations. Power Forward noted Stacey Abrams, once the Democratic candidate for Georgia's governor, was a senior counsel for just one of those five groups, Rewiring America, and that there is no evidence she engaged in any illegal activity. At $7 billion, the Climate United Fund is the largest recipient of Greenhouse Gas Reduction fund money. Climate United partnered with Forward Mobility, an electric truck startup whose CEO and co-founder is Biden and Harris donor Matt LeDucq. He's a Silicon Valley green energy executive. Climate United says Forward Mobility is a charging provider and not receiving any funding from Climate United. Climate United, Power Forward communities and the Coalition for Green Capital got a total of $14 billion from the Biden climate fund. They've sued the EPA after the Trump administration froze their grants. A federal judge temporarily blocked the EPA from clawing back the money, saying the EPA had not put forward credible evidence of fraud. Shannon? BREAM: Something tells me that dispute is far from over. EDSON: Still going. BREAM: All right, Rich, thank you. So Israel is ordering troops to advance deeper into the Gaza Strip, vowing to cover more ground until Hamas releases the remaining hostages. Israel had already cut off supplies and aid to Gaza. It is believed that 24 of the remaining 59 hostages held by Hamas are still alive. Russian drones targeted a UkrainianBlack Sea port city today sparking massive fires. The move underlined Moscow's intention to pursue aerial attacks amid its agreement to halt strikes on energy facilities. But the head of the Odesa region says the city suffered power outages which could indicate damage to energy infrastructure. Washington, D.C., area health officials are investigating potential measles exposure in this region. Two additional cases were confirmed in travelers arriving at Dulles International Airport on March 5th. The two Maryland residents there were traveling together internationally. Virginia officials confirm a separate case earlier this month of a person traveling through Dulles on the same date, but they say the cases are unrelated. Five years ago, you remember it well, Americans were isolating in their homes, watching ""Tiger King,"" ordering food delivery, and doing most of it alone. Many say they still feel the impact of some of the policies put in place during the pandemic. My colleague, Bret Baier, takes a look. BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Thanks, Shannon. We have been looking back at recommendations and mandates issued during the COVID-19 pandemic, what we knew then versus what we know now. At this moment, we can tell you much of the country believes that the pandemic forever changed this country. Tonight, we take a look at the lasting impact. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There's a stain that's going to be there forever. There's going to be an asterisk, and it's going to be there. BAIER: From business to education. ROBERT SANBORN, CHILDREN AT RISK: They are still recovering from the pandemic academically. So there's that pressure. There is all this violence. That adds extra pressure to these kids. BAIER: To crime and mental health. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: COVID-19 put a strain on a lot of families, and so that strain is still there. BAIER: The coronavirus pandemic has left a lasting impact. BREA PERRY, INDIANA UNIVERSITY: Social distancing policies and behaviors exacerbated the rates of depression and anxiety which were already rising prior to the pandemic. BAIER: Many believe we are still feeling the lingering effects from shutdowns, social distancing, and the drastic change of routine. According to a Gallup poll, 47 percent of Americans believe their lives are back to normal, 40 percent think their lives will never get back to how they were pre-COVID. DARIN BRAWLEY, COMPTON UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT: Schools are struggling to catch up related to the pandemic because of the lasting impact learning loss has had on students. BAIER: The nation's report card released this year showed students have continued to lose ground on reading skills and made little improvement in math. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't think it's surprising. BAIER: The National Center for Education Statistics determined one-third of public school students ended the 23-24 school year at least one grade level behind in at least one subject. LINDA MCMAHON, EDUCATION SECRETARY: Well, I think that's been the president's, you know, hue and cry. He said we are spending more money per pupil than any country in the world, and we are seeing less results. That's a clear indicator that we are not doing the best thing we can do for our students. BAIER: Gallup also surveyed parents about the impact of the pandemic on their kids. Twenty-two percent reported ongoing issue in social skills, 21 percent in mental health. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This will last for a couple weeks and we'll get back in school, maybe. But who knew that we would be out of school for such an indefinite amount of time? BAIER: Right now, just 24 percent of Americans are satisfied with the quality of public education, the lowest amount on record. Some educators believe the low test scores could be driven by chronic absenteeism. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Parents should be really concerned about this. BAIER: A student is considered chronically absent if they miss 18 to 20 school days in a year. DANYELA EGOROV, MANHATTAN INSTITUTE: Forty percent of kindergartens in New York City are chronically absent. They are missing more than 10 percent of school days. BAIER: New York was not alone. For the 23-24 school year in Arizona, one in three first through eighth graders were chronically absent. In Washington, 56 percent of high schoolers missed at least 10 percent of school days. Nationally, absenteeism is eight percent higher than in 2019. EGOROV: Parents are much more comfortable now with kids skipping school. BAIER: There's also been a shift in prices since the pandemic. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They're using it as an excuse no. There's no reason to raise the price. It was just an excuse. BAIER: In February of 2020, gas prices were around $2.50. In May of 2020 they fell under $2 due to a lack of demand. But as the country reopened, prices began to rise and were driven even higher by the war in Ukraine, topping out at more than $5 in June of 2022. Prices have yet to return to under $3. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think it's crazy that we're at the point in which we either eat or put gas. BAIER: Transportation overall is up 34 percent since 2020, food prices up 24 percent, and housing rose around 23 percent. Some economists argue stimulus checks issued by both presidents Trump and Biden helped fuel price increases and have forced the Federal Reserve to adjust rates. Before the pandemic interest rates were at around 1.5 percent. Because of inflation the Fed has yet to lower rates past 4.3 percent. JEROME POWELL, CHAIR, FEDERAL RESERVE: Despite elevated levels of uncertainty, the U.S. economy continues to be in good place. BAIER: Positive mental health has also declined, 75 percent rate their mindset as good or excellent. While a strong majority, it's the lowest percentage since Gallup began its survey. Healthcare workers are affected, too. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We do see increased rates of anxiety, stress, depression, PTSD in healthcare workers as a whole. (END VIDEO TAPE) BAIER (on camera): Americans are also worried about the possibility of another global pandemic. According to Gallup, most adults are somewhat or very worried. Just 15 percent are not worried at all. We'll see what comes next. We'll send it back to you. BREAM: All right, Bret, thank you. Up next, the panel as President Trump searches for legal wins, Democrats are doing some soul searching of their own. And later, it is Friday, so you know we got it, ""Notable Quotables."" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: They are bad people. We don't want them in our country. We can't let a judge say that he wants -- he didn't run for president. REP. JAMIE RASKIN, (D-MD): It seems like a very cut and dry legal issue, and Judge Boasberg rightfully is demanding that the administration comply with the law. SEN. JOSH HAWLEY, (R-MO): These district courts, these are the entry level federal courts, they do not have the authority to go out and to say, Mr. President, you can't do this. We're going to bind everybody nationwide. They don't have that authority. (END VIDEO CLIP) BREAM: Well, they are doing it for now. So let's bring in our panel to talk about that and more, Real Clear Politics White House correspondent Philip Wegmann, Shelby Talcott, political reporter for Semafor, and Alex Gangitano, White House correspondent for ""The Hill."" Welcome everyone. So this back and forth, here's a bit of ""Reuters"" report about this hearing this afternoon the judge had wit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 we're waiting to find out what happens next here. There is a hearing at the appellate court on Monday, but this is very much a live controversy. SHELBY TALCOTT, POLITICS REPORTER, SEMAFOR: Yes, and what I will say is the administration in many ways has planned for this, right? The president talked about invoking the Alien Enemies Act on the campaign trail. And not only were they planning to invoke the Alien Enemies Act, but they have been really preparing for legal pushback on the Alien Enemies Act and on a whole other host of things that the president has decided to do executive orders on. And so in this sense, this 2.0 Trump administration, it's much more prepared for the legal pushback than 1.0 Trump administration. BREAM: Yes, they had four years to think about that and get that strategy together. President Trump says this on Truth Social," """"No district court judge or any judge can assume the duties of the president of the United States. Only crime and chaos would result. Make America Great Again!"""" So Alex", it sparks this whole conversation, is it the Supreme Court that's going to take it up? Are they going to get it done on the Hill with regard to letting one district judge, there are hundreds of them across the country, shut down not only something in their district but for the entire country? ALEX GANGITANO," """"THE HILL"""": That's right", and that's been the argument of the White House they don't have the authority to do this. The White House has the authority to do it, and a district judge, federal judge, whoever else, can't control if we remove people from the country. But that's the big question. Does this go up to the Supreme Court? I think, like Shelby alluded to, I think they are ready for that fight. The White House said we are really for any fight going up to the Supreme Court level. They have been preparing for this. But does Congress step in and say let us just handle this through the legislative process, but as a way that is supporting the White House and supporting Trump here. We'll have to see. But I think they are ready for whatever fight comes. BREAM: Yes. I do think that they launched a lot of legal fights knowing it would immediately go into an injunction fight, hoping that they would get to the Supreme Court for that ultimate answer that they are after. I want to put up this look at injunctions halting presidential policies, and you can see these over the various administrations. President Trump just, you know, a few weeks in in the second term is already ahead of the full eight-year term of President Obama, four years for President Biden. They say that it's something that is unique to him, but is it in part because they are instituting so much legal activity on their own, knowing these things are going to be challenged? PHILIP WEGMANN, REAL CLEAR POLITICS: Certainly the Trump administration is moving quickly, and they expected these injunctions. A lot of this, as the rest of us have said, is a dress rehearsal for a Supreme Court showdown. But I think what is unique here, as opposed to the first Trump administration, is that previously they were happy to work their way through the appeal process like they did with the travel ban. This time around they are looking at these injunctions and they're saying this is unfair. Democrats don't have to deal with this. And so I think they are taking a play out of Democratic playbook here. We heard AOC call for the impeachment of Alito. We heard President Biden say that he was going to move forward with the eviction moratorium even though he didn't know it was unconstitutional. Now it seems that the Trump White House, they are talking about defiance, talking about impeachments. They are trying to force Justice Roberts hands because they want this to be ruled in their direction, and they also want an end to these injunctions, and they think that this is the only area where Democrats can stand up to them. BREAM: Several of the justices have talked about taking a look at this, and this might be, one of these cases might be the right vehicle for them to do that. In the meantime," Democrats have a lot of internal angst that is spilling out into the public. Here is what """"Politico"""" writes. """"We dug into the polls and Democrats in Congress should be very afraid. The intensity of the anger roiling the party is at a historic level", suggesting a breach between congressional Democrats and the party grassroots so severe that it could reshape the 26 primary election. The numbers are clear. No longer satisfied with the status quo in their party," Democrats are on the verge of a Tea Party style intraparty revolt."""" And Alex", we're seeing it play out at these parties. Yes, Republicans are taking a lot of heat out there at these town halls, but so are Democrats from the left. GANGITANO: That's right. It seems like Democrats are broken into multiple parties here. There's progressives that are saying we need to be the activist party. We need to be protesting. We need to be loud. There are centrists saying that made us lose in 2024. We don't want to be the activist party. We need to rethink our branding. We need to rethink our leadership. And so it seems like they are in this Tea Party-esque moment of where does the party go from here and what kind of factions get created in this moment? But I think a lot of it is also who is the leadership? You know, is it Senate Minority Leader Schumer who allowed for the CR to pass, didn't let a shutdown happen? Well, a lot of progressives are really upset that he teamed up, so to speak, with Republicans. So, I think then progressives are trying to speak up, but they don't really have that voice that they thought they did. So, right now, they are definitely in this rebuilding phase. And it seems like nothing is really landing, especially as we watch as constituents seem very upset with them in their districts. BREAM: Well, former President Biden and the former first lady say we will come help. NBC reporting we want back in, saying that the former president has told some Democratic leaders he will raise funds, campaign, do anything necessary for Democrats to recover lost ground as the Trump administration rolls back programs the party helped designed. According to people close to him, though, Shelby, so far Biden's overture seems to have fallen flat. TALCOTT: Yes, and we heard President Trump today basically said that he would welcome that because, of course, we saw what happened on the campaign trail. And I think part of the reason, maybe the entire reason that a lot of Democrats are not picking this offer up from former President Biden is because there's frustration that he decided to jump into the race a second time. They're angry with him. And they also saw how politically volatile he ended up being for the party. And they are not really willing to go back to that. BREAM: Well," we have got reporting from """"The New York Post""""", and it starts out with a quote from a onetime senior White House adviser, saying the Bidens are living in alternative universe that revolves only around them. WEGMANN: Well, perhaps President Biden has gotten over that cold that he had at the Atlanta debate. Not to be harsh, I mean, I understand the temptation to try and fill that role as an elder statesman. Presidents are normally more popular after they leave office. But to Shelby's point, there is a lot of resentment from Democrats because they just don't just think that Biden gummed up the works. They think that by sticking around he greased the skids for Donald Trump to come back a second time. BREAM: So I want to quickly touch on this, because we have a ton of new poll numbers out this week including how people think the president is doing with regard to any number of these foreign hotspots, Israel, China, Mexico, Ukraine, Russia, Canada. Shelby, is he pretty much upside down on all of them. And he has got a town of foreign policy to handle. TALCOTT: Yes, this is something that this president has been uniquely focused on this administration. It is a very difficult thing for him to get to. But, when I talked to the administration officials, they are not worried about the poll numbers right now. They say we are two months in. We've got a long ways to go. BREAM: Philip? WEGMANN: I think that you see a president who is more focused on his legacy, he's more confident than he was during the first time around, has not only a clear set vision for what he wants to do with foreign policy, but he's surrounded by either converts or true believers from the very beginning when it comes to his America first foreign policy vision. So, I don't think that they're living and dying by polling numbers. I think they are going to stay the course. BREAM: Well, and Alex, quick final word to you. As we know, Saudi Arabia, Ukraine, Russia, they are going to be these delegations that go there and try to inch forward on some kind of cease-fire deal. GANGITANO: That's right. And they have been successful between Witkoff and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. And I think the Trump administration has a lot of faith in the people that he is sending over to Saudi Arabia to try to get some sort of cease-fire deal. And so I think they are hopeful that those numbers can go up, those polling numbers can increase if they can pull these off. BREAM: And side note, Steve Witkoff is going to be on with me on FOX NEWS SUNDAY. So we will ask him about all of these hotspots. Next up," we're going to have """"Notable Quotables."""" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BREAM: It is Friday. Time for """"Notable Quotables."""" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And splashdown", crew nine back on earth.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why does Elon Musk dress like he just got out of a Hot Topic? DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: I will sign an executive order to begin eliminating the federal Department of Education. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think this is ill-fated. LINDA MCMAHON, EDUCATION SECRETARY: We spent almost $3 trillion. We've seen our scores continue to decline. We are doing something wrong. We need to change.

But we will get there. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are coming to terms with the fact that our daughter has drowned. BAIER: The United States has been concerned about China's influence in Africa. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's not that China if waxing in Africa. It's more that America is waning. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think I can kick most of their ass.

Coming up, DOGE Day-Two. We've got more of Bret's interview with Elon Musk and his top team, diving into specific actions and consequences of their work. Plus, in it for the long haul. Fox News will take you inside the military armored vehicles deployed to the southern border. And ""WHATEVER HAPPENED TO"" rebuilding Southern California after those historic wildfires. But first, breaking news tonight, President Trump may be expanding his tariff policies, eyeing pharmaceuticals next. The president's remarks coming as new economic data on consumer spending and inflation crushed Wall Street. The Federal Reserve's key inflation measure rose more than expected in February. And here is a look at where we wound up. The Dow plummeted 716 points. The S&P 500, well, that fell 112. NASDAQ dropped 481. That's for the week. The Dow was down nearly one percent. The S&P fell 1-1/2 percent. NASDAQ dropped 2-1/2. Senior national correspondent Rich Edson is at the White House now with the story, Rich, everyone is watching tonight. RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Aishah. Well, in a week, President Trump's 25 percent auto tariffs are scheduled to begin as President Trump is defending his tariff policy. He says more may be coming, especially on pharmaceuticals. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: -- percent tariff. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We are looking at a certain number that will be enough to get the drugs and the pharmaceutical companies, bringing their product into our country. EDSON (voice over): Stocks fell today with unexpectedly higher inflation, lower consumer sentiment, and as the White House holds steady on its tariff strategy. The president also spoke with Mark Carney, the new prime minister of Canada, another target of Trump's tariffs. He called it an extremely productive call, and that, ""We agree on many things, and we'll be meeting immediately after Canada's upcoming election to work on elements of politics, business, and all other factors, that will end up being great for both the United States of America and Canada. The administration's focus today even reached farther north. TRUMP: We have to have Greenland. EDSON (voice over): Vice President Vance and National Security Adviser Michael Waltz confined their Greenland trip to U.S. military base, as protests were planned in the capital. Vance says Denmark has under invested in its territory, and it's time for the U.S. to step in. J.D. VANCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Are there immediate plans to expand our military presence? No. But are there -- are there general objectives that we want to accomplish that will certainly require us investing more resources? EDSON (voice over): Which has drawn the attention of American adversaries. VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA (through translator): Everybody knows very well about the U.S. plans to take over Greenland. EDSON (voice over): And political adversaries. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, suggested in The New York Times today that Trump is running the U.S. like a banana republic. And that ""The Trump approach is dumb power. Instead of a strong America using all our strength to lead the world and confront our adversaries, Mr. Trump's America will be increasingly blind and blundering, feeble, and friendless."" (END VIDEOTAPE) EDSON (on camera): President Trump also defended his pardon today of Trevor Milton. He is the founder of an electric vehicle start-up. The president said that Milton came highly recommended and was prosecuted because he is a Trump supporter. Milton was sentenced to prison for fraud. Aishah? HASNIE: Rich, live at the White House. Thank you. Also, breaking tonight, a federal judge has now ordered the Trump administration to stop the dismantling of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. This is the agency that investigates financial fraud. The order requires the agency's -- agency to stop mass firings and deleting data, and go back to full operational capacity until at least the legal case is fully resolved. Well, dozens of lawsuits regarding Trump administration policies are now playing out in the courts. None may be bigger, though, than the battle over deportations, challenging a key promise of the Trump administration. Correspondent David Spunt, joining me now with an update on that and other cases. Good evening to you, David. DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Aishah, good evening to you. President Trump has been back in the White House for two months, so more cases now making their way to the Supreme Court, the highest court now with another case challenging a Trump administration executive action. The DOJ today, asking the justices to allow deportations of suspected criminal aliens to resume under the 1798 wartime law called the Alien Enemies Act.\ The administration cited that rarely used authority, Aishah, when deporting 261 suspected Venezuelan gang members living in the U.S. to a notorious prison in El Salvador, without court hearings. President Trump has agreed judges cannot interfere his diplomatic in security decision making. The federal judge overseen the case extended his temporary pause hours ago until April 12th. He is under attack by President Trump. His name is James Boasberg. Trump has asked him to be impeached. Boasberg is overseeing the El Salvador flights case and a new case that popped up involving that Signal chat, where National Security Adviser Mike Waltz accidentally invited a journalist into a group of Cabinet members, discussing an upcoming attack on Houthi rebels. Attorney General Pam Bondi also critical. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PAM BONDI, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES: He shouldn't be on any of these cases. He cannot be objective. He has made that crystal clear. (END VIDEO CLIP) SPUNT: Boasberg and other federal judges are randomly assigned to federal cases. He noted as much in that Signal hearing yesterday, where he ordered the government to preserve Signal records from March 11th through the 15th, during the timeline of military preparations. And Aishah, within the last 30 minutes, we learned an appeals court is allowing DOGE to continue operating at USAID, the international aid organization, temporary win for the Department of Government Efficiency in the Trump administration. But this too, as I mentioned at the beginning of this report, could make its way to the Supreme Court just one more case. Busy time. HASNIE: You know, the president talked about everything he was going to do in great detail, including using this law on the campaign trail, nobody batted an eye. And now, everyone is paying attention. David. SPUNT: Very closely. HASNIE: Thank you very much for paying attention for us. Thank you. SPUNT: Welcome. HASNIE: In the aftermath of the surprise withdrawal of Congresswoman Elise Stefanik's nomination as U.N. ambassador, Republicans are now focusing on passing their big, beautiful bill to cut spending and taxes. There was a hope for the House to approve it by Easter, but that deadline is likely to slip. Here is senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Republicans aim to cut taxes and shave the size of government. But can they do it with a razor thin majority? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's a lot like going to the dentist. I mean, we are constantly pulling teeth. PERGRAM (voice over): House Republicans fretting that their narrow majority could dwindle even more. REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): They seem to be panicking about the two special elections in Florida. PERGRAM (voice over): Tuesday's House contest in heavily Republican districts are closer than expected. Still, some Republicans are optimistic. REP. BYRON DONALDS (R-FL): I think that we're going to win both of these seats on Tuesday. I think Republican voters in these districts are going to turn out. PERGRAM (voice over): Regardless President Trump took out an insurance policy, yanking the nomination of Elise Stefanik to become U.N. ambassador, tethering her to the House to pass the so-called big, beautiful bill. TRUMP: I said, Elise, would you do me a favor? We can -- we cannot take a chance. We have a slim margin. PERGRAM (voice over): The congresswoman taking one for the team. REP. ELISE STEFANIK (R-NY): It's tough to count these votes every day. PERGRAM (voice over): House Speaker Mike Johnson warned President Trump about the numbers issue last fall when he poached three House Republicans for his administration. REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): I have begged and pleaded with the new president, enough already. I said, please, sir. No. PERGRAM (voice over): The Senate is now prepping a new framework for the bill, but House conservatives are wary of their Senate colleague. REP. JODEY ARRINGTON (R-TX): They should be very careful to keep our framework, our balanced budget resolution framework, intact if we're going to be able to lock in tax permanence. (END VIDEOTAPE) PERGRAM (on camera): House Speaker Mike Johnson is backing off his Easter deadline to pass the bill. That means the final version might not be ready for weeks, exactly when Stefanik seat was likely vacant. Aishah? HASNIE: Chad Pergram, live for us at Capitol Hill. Chad, thank you. PERGRAM: Thank you. HASNIE: The Trump administration sparing no expense to fight illegal immigration. And tonight, a Fox News exclusive ride along in a massive tactical armored vehicle, being used to bolster the mission at the southern border. Correspondent Brooke Taylor had a front row seat, and reports now from El Paso. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BROOKE TAYLOR, FOX NEWS CHANNEL NATIONAL NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice over): This massive, eight-wheeled armored vehicle is known as a Stryker. For the first time in more than a decade, two Strykers have been deployed to the El Paso Sector. The Defense Department is expected to send more along the border within the next few weeks. TAYLOR: What's the point of this and why have this out here? What does it do for you guys? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, one of the main things that it provides is surveillance capability with it. It could see up to two miles, like with the infrared. Once anything pops up. We just call Border Patrol, and then they roll up on us. TAYLOR (voice over): Strykers can be armed with cannons or machine guns to fight in combat. This footage from 2019 shows U.S. soldiers training with a Stryker in Germany. But the Strykers at the border are not equipped with these weapons, and the DoD says there are no plans to do so. Instead, they are being used to help with surveillance and to act as a deterrent. TAYLOR: And the area that we're stationed in right now, basically gives them a bird's eye view of the border. You have Juarez, Mexico over there, a known smuggling corridor, and also an area where we've seen some of the most got aways. TAYLOR (voice over): On Thursday, Border Patrol sources tell Fox News, there were just 32 encounters in the El Paso Sector. On the same day last year, there were more than 1,000 encounters. HAMID NIKSERESHT, SUPERVISOR, BORDER PATROL SPECIAL OPERATIONS: We also want to make sure those numbers don't go back up, right? So, we will also look to bring in assets like this that essentially impress upon terrorist cartels and terrorist gangs that when the United States says national security cannot exist without border security, we absolutely mean it. (END VIDEOTAPE) TAYLOR: And border patrol agents say this means bad business for those cartels, because migrants right now don't want to pay thousands and thousands of dollars to get smuggled across the border only to risk getting deported right back. Aishah. HASNIE: Brooke, excellent reporting. Thank you. Up next, Elon Musk and the DOGE team get into the specifics of their roles, their top priorities, and what they are finding in all of their digging. But first, ""BEYOND OUR BORDERS"" tonight, a 7.7 magnitude earthquake. And get this, a 6.4 aftershock, rocking Burma and Thailand, destroying buildings and other structures there. Watch this incredible video. At least 144 people are dead now in Burma, with hundreds more injured. In Thailand, it's not any better. Emergency responders there say a building collapse killed at least 10 people, and dozens more are still missing. And this is a live look at Rome, one of the big stories there tonight. Pilgrims flocking to the medieval hilltop town of Assisi to honor the Catholic Church's most celebrated saints. The observance is to commemorate St. Francis Sinclair, and the church's first millennial saint, Carlo Acutis, whose body is now available for viewing. Acutis will be canonized on April 27th. Those are just some of the other stories ""BEYOND OUR BORDERS"" tonight. We will be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HASNIE: Tonight, we are bringing you part two of Bret's exclusive interview with Elon Musk and members of his DOGE team. And in this segment, we're going to take a deeper dive into the roles of some key players here. Health care entrepreneur Brad Smith at the Health and Human Services Department, Engineer Aram Moghaddassi as a software expert, Cloud Software Group CEO, Tom Krause at the Treasury Department, and Morgan Stanley banker, Anthony Armstrong. All very important names. He is at the Office of Personnel Management. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let's check back on -- ANTHONY ARMSTRONG, OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT, DOGE: It's a lot of money sloshing out the door. We spend as a country about three billion dollars a day in interest expense. It's probably the first thing that got me focused on this and thinking about, how do we get to this place? How do we spend more on interest expense than we do on defense, for example. So, there is -- there is a lot going out the door, but my focus actually while I have been here has been on the -- on the agency side and on the work force side and how is the federal work force of 2.3 million civilians, how is it constituted, how is it -- how does it function? And there are 259 discrete departments in the federal government. One of the things we did was we did an ontology of the full federal government using A.I. and brute force to map out 16,000 boxes on the federal government org chart and then attack -- how do we get this to be efficient? For example, at the federal government, one of the things we have learned is you have got four payroll processors in the federal government. So, it's 2.3 million employees get paid. They get paid through four payroll processors. One is in the Department of Interior. One is in the Department of Agriculture. They actually do very good work at this team at the Agriculture Department. But it's at the Agriculture Department. And they serve 76 federal agencies from the Agriculture Department for payroll. Everything from the IRS to the Smithsonian gets paid through the Agriculture Department. So that just doesn't make any sense. There should be one. You can debate where it should go. You should get the efficiencies of pulling those together. You should get the information that comes from pulling those together. So, that's the -- that's what we're -- that's what we're facing on the work force front. And you made the comment about shooting from the hip, and I want to just talk about that for a moment. BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANCHOR: That was just what critics say. ARMSTRONG: Yes, it couldn't be further on the truth. So, I want to talk about what we're doing with these restructuring plans. This is -- we literally go in -- and we're doing this mostly at nights and over the weekends with the secretaries of these agencies and their senior staff, and we're going line by line in the employee org charts, line by line from the bottom up, talking about every function, is it duplicative? Yes, OK, what are we going to do with these 40 communications offices? We don't need 40. How many do we need? How are we going to consolidate them? What's the right team to pull that together? And it is happening at the highest level and it is line by line, box by box on these org charts. BAIER: With these secretaries? ARMSTRONG: Absolutely, the secretaries and their senior staff. And also, really importantly senior career staff. And I have got to say, I think all of us have been -- it's been an amazing experience. There are some very, very smart, hardworking people who are career civil servants, and they're involved in these conversations as well to build out these plans for what these organizations should look like. BAIER: Tom Krause, working at Treasury, you are having access to the payment system, oversees all the outgoing payments. Essentially, those payments were going places we didn't know where they were going, right? TOM KRAUSE, TREASURY DEPARTMENT, DOGE: Yes, unfortunately, that's the case, Bret. We're serving 580-plus agencies, and up until very recently, effectively they could say make the payment, and Treasury just sent it out as fast as possible, no verification. And so, what we're doing is what any household would do. But imagine you're a household, you have a bank account, everyone has an ATM card connected to that account, everyone has a checkbook connected to that account. It's not just your children. It's not just your parents. It's your in-law. It's your extended family, and they all can go to the account and disburse funds, no questions asked, no justification, no verification. And so, all we're trying to do is put in basic controls. And then the last thing is really on the accounting side of things. Today, when a bill is passed, a budget bill, or a continuing resolution, as we have right now, that actually does set a budget. It doesn't set a budget for the whole government as a whole. It actually sets it by fund. And so, if you think about it, there's actually 11,000 funds across these 580-plus agencies. But, today, on a real-time basis, not even a near-real- time basis, we cannot account for what's being disbursed by fund. BAIER: And the hope is to be able to turn that where you could see it, right? (CROSSTALK) KRAUSE: So, we can see it, and we're very close to producing that. And why is that important, well, by law, these agencies at the fund level are not allowed to spend more than their budget. But if you don't have the information and you don't track it, how do you know? BAIER: And on that the technical side of moving these computers to new age, I mean, it's a challenge, right? ARAM MOGHADDASSI, SOFTWARE ENGINEER, DOGE: Absolutely. And one thing I will say is that almost every longtime government employee that I have met is incredibly excited about taking a serious look at the fraud. They have seen it firsthand for many years, and see this as kind of an opportunity to use technology to address $500 billion a year of fraud. I think that, on the modernization side, it might actually surprise people how basic the improvements we're making are. ELON MUSK, DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY: Yes, this is really -- we can't emphasize this enough, what Aram is saying, is like the things we're talking about are so basic that the federal government can't pass an audit. It doesn't know where the money is going? So, what we're talking about is just like being able to pass an audit. It will enable taxpayers to know where the money is going and know that they're hard-earned tax dollars are being spent well. BAIER: But the biggest pot is either in Social Security or I guess Medicare and Medicaid, right? BRAD SMITH, DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY: Yes, but I can -- I can speak to Medicare and Medicaid a little bit. We're 100 percent committed to protecting Medicare and Medicaid. But at the same time, the Government Accountability Office, GAO, has said there's $84 billion a year in improper payments. And say, how does that -- how does that happen? I will just give you a couple of examples. So, one, we're finding there's actually an article on The Wall Street Journal about this, that there's individuals who are getting paid or the health plans are getting paid in two separate states for the same individual. So, New York pays for somebody's Medicaid and Connecticut pays for somebody's Medicaid. And you say, how could that possibly happen? And the reason is, they have individual data systems. They run their programs separately. The federal government kind of, sort of collects the data but does not put it together to identify those opportunities. So, that's a really concrete example of we're paying twice and we don't need to be paying twice. Paying once won't affect anybody's health care, but it will save us half the money. (END VIDEOTAPE) HASNIE: And that was Bret Baier. Up next, he will go one-on-one with Elon Musk, as the Tesla CEO answers one of your questions and also explains what he sees as the biggest obstacles the U.S. is facing. And a little bit later, rebuilding is a slow go out west after wildfires scorched Southern California. We will take a look at why that is in tonight's ""WHATEVER HAPPENED TO."" (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HASNIE: In our final installment of our spotlight on the Department of Government and Efficiency, Bret speaks to one-on-one with Elon Musk about what issues keep him up at night, the scrutiny he is facing, his involvement in politics outside of DOGE, and whether or not he thinks his work with the department can have lasting effects. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BAIER: Here is Keith on X, says: ""Executive actions can be undone with the next president. What is the team doing to ensure the government waste and overregulation is permanently reduced. I assume you are working with Congress. That's part of it. But -- ELON MUSK, DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY: Yes, we certainly would like a lot of what we're doing to be permanently enshrined in law. But a lot of the changes we are making are very basic things that I think are likely to remain in place, such as the improvements to the Treasury financial system, to have better -- a better understanding of how and why payments are made. So, the fact that payments now must have a payment code that corresponds to congressional appropriation and must have an explanation for the payment and someone to call to ask about the payment. So we made those changes to the system. They weren't there before. I think those changes will remain. And so all these things that we are doing, like the one I just mentioned, will enable the government to actually pass an audit. It's at such a basic level that you have to stand back and recalibrate just how bad things can be, because you think it can't possibly be that bad, and it is. It will basically blow your mind. There's no way that any commercial company could possibly survive if it operated like the federal government. BAIER: You are still involved in politics. You were big in the election, obviously in Pennsylvania. Now, I guess you are in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race. Why plug in? MUSK: Well, the Democrats are trying to redraw the district in Wisconsin. We're trying to stop the Democrats from gerrymandering Wisconsin to remove two House seats. That's what this whole Supreme Court justice case is about. So I really want to emphasize to people out there, if you are in Wisconsin, go out and vote. You can do early voting for the Supreme Court. If you have afferents and family in Wisconsin, please urge them to vote for Brad Schimel. If we don't, we could lose control of the House, and all of the government reforms could be shut down. BAIER: Finally, what's the biggest thing for you that keeps you up at night? MUSK: Well, there are a lot of things, I suppose, that I worry about. But, and some of these things will seem esoteric to people. The birth rate is very low in almost every country. And unless that changes, civilization will disappear. America had the lowest birth rate, I believe, ever, that was last year. Places like Korea, the birth rate is one-third replacement rate. That means in three generations Korea will be three or four percent of its current size. And nothing seems to be turning that around. Humanity is dying. And people -- it's just not something we evolve to react to. I worry generally about the strength of America. America is the central column that holds up all the places in civilization. So if we've got the temple of western civilization, America is the central column. If that column fails, it's all over. You can't run off to New Zealand or some other place. It's over. So either we strengthen that column and make sure America is strong and will be strong for a long time, or that roof is coming down. BAIER: I think we got into detail today about what you all are doing and demystified some of that. For the people who look at you and your business sense about SpaceX or Starlink, can you tell them specifically there's not a conflict of interest in how you are doing it or what you are doing and the contracts that you are getting with the government? MUSK: Everything I do is under extreme scrutiny. BAIER: Every day. MUSK: Yes. So there is not an action I can take that doesn't get like scrutinized six ways to Sunday. Every action that the DOGE team does is public. We put it on the website. It's the most amount of transparency there's been about any government thing ever. So, it would be -- even if I wanted to, I couldn't get away with it. In fact, it's actually disadvantageous for me to be in the government, not advantageous. If I wasn't in the government, I could lobby. And I could push for things that are advantageous to my companies, and probably get it, probably receive them. My companies are suffering because I'm in the government. You just pointed that out a moment ago. BAIER: Right. MUSK: You think it help sales if dealerships are being fire-bombed? Of course not. And Tesla customers are being intimidated all over the country and all over Europe. Does that help Tesla? I mean, have you Tim Walz, who is a huge jerk, running around on stage with the Tesla stock price, where the stock price had gone in half, and he was overjoyed. What an evil thing to do. What a creep, what a jerk. Like, who derives joy from that? And it was pointed out to him that actually, no, the Minnesota state pension fund is a major investor in Tesla. But he didn't care, he was so overjoyed by Tesla stock going in half. So does that sound like a good person to you? I don't think so. BAIER: You know, when I was growing up, we didn't have Internet. Then we didn't have cell phones, then we got them. Then we got the Apple phone and all the technology that I have just seen in my lifetime. The fact that we are where we are, if you are talking to an audience, where are we in five years? Where are we in 10 years? MUSK: I do think there is the potential for a great future as long as America remains the land of freedom and opportunity. So what is -- so freedom means that the government does not infringe upon your personal liberties, that you can do what you want as long as it doesn't harm another person. The land of opportunity means that you succeed on the basis of your merits, on how hard you work and how good you are at your job. Those fundamental principles are what will ensure a great future. And that's what President Trump is committed to doing. That's what the DOGE team is committed to doing. And if we succeed, I think we'll have a wonderful future. BAIER: Well, Elon, we really appreciate the time. And I think we dispelled some rumors and got into some very specifics that people wanted to hear, so thank you very much. MUSK: You're welcome. (END VIDEO TAPE) AISHAH HASNIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: That is our Bret Baier. Coming up, Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate Susan Crawford says that she will recuse herself from a new case being brought against Elon Musk, against Wisconsin's attorney general is now seeking to stop him from giving away $2 million this weekend to Wisconsin voters ahead of the critical state Supreme Court election. That election happens on Tuesday. Whatever happened to rebuilding Pacific Palisades after the destructive January wildfires in southern California? We are going to take you there, and we will take a look at it coming up real soon. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) HASNIE: Welcome back. In tonight's ""Whatever Happened To?"" segment, we go back to Pacific Palisades after that devastating California wildfire earlier this year. Officials are looking at ways to prevent future destruction from firs amid concerns over overregulation that's hindering efforts to rebuild there. Senior national correspondent William La Jeunesse has the story from Los Angeles. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) BONITA HORNSTEIN, LOST HOME IN WILDFIRES: I love this community with all my heart. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So are you going to stay? HORNSTEIN: Absolutely. WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The Palisades fire wiped out 37 years of memories for Bonita Hornstein. HORNSTEIN: A lot of the us are underinsured, and we are just trying to figure out a way to rebuild our community. LA JEUNESSE: Most southern California homes are wood-framed. Victims in this neighborhood recently gathered to study new ways to rebuild. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You can see it starting to blow red. LA JEUNESSE: This composite concrete block doesn't burn. It's one solution to keep homes safe in the state's most flammable areas. JANEK DOMBROWA, ARCHITECT: If you have a building where the fire can get into the walls or into the floor and into roof, you don't have a chance. LA JEUNESSE: Fire destroyed more than 13,000 homes in the Palisades in Altadena. So far, more than half of the owners have signed up for Core of engineers debris removal. LAURA ALFANO, REALTOR: We're hoping that people can get back in, I'd like to say two-and-a-half years, but it's probably going to be more like three to four. LA JEUNESSE: Altadena's first vacant lot sold for $100,000 over asking. Lots in the Palisades are also moving fast, half-price or above. ALFANO: We're seeing the ones in Palisades coming on almost daily, 10 at a time. And the sales rate has been at 20 percent. So, as they are coming on, 20 percent of them have been sold. LA JEUNESSE: The underinsured and some older homeowners are selling their land, mostly to developers. Others want to stay. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We decided that we're going to rebuild because this is our very, very special place. LA JEUNESSE: So aside from clearing the lot, getting a new building permit and construction loan, owners face another hurdle -- insurance. Many carriers still paying claims from this fire are not writing new policies in California, forcing owners onto the state plan, which, in many cases, cannot fully ensure the value of a rebuild. In Los Angeles, William La Jeunesse, FOX News. (END VIDEO TAPE) HASNIE: We cannot forget about those folks out there. Up next, the panel on Trump tariffs and the economy. But first, here's what some of our FOX affiliates around the country are covering for us tonight. FOX 67 in the Rio Grande Valley here as severe storms cause widespread flooding across Cameron County, trapping families inside their homes, submerging cars, prompting multiple emergency rescues. They got about a foot of rain in less than 48 hours there. Wow. And this is a live look at St. Augustine, Florida. One of the big stories there tonight from FOX 4, archaeologists unearth signs of British control in Florida from the 1700s after centuries of Spanish rule. City archaeologists identified a dry moat and a fortified military outpost that had been constructed back in 1781. That's tonight's live look outside the beltway from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: We're going to end up with a very good relationship with Canada and a lot of the other countries. Some we probably won't. It won't be so pleasant. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, (D-NY) SENATE MINORITY LEADER: Donald Trump's trade war has accomplished only one thing to date -- chaos. PETER NAVARRO, WHITE HOUSE SENIOR COUNSELOR: What happens when President Trump does tariffs? We get trillions, trillions of dollars of new investment into this country. And that's the key to keeping down inflation and keeping real wages up. (END VIDEO CLIP) HASNIE: OK, let's bring in our panel tonight, Byron York, chief political correspondent of ""The Washington Examiner,"" ""Axios"" political reporter Hans Nichols, and Meridith McGraw, White House reporter for ""The Wall Street Journal"". I mixed yo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 but you are all here. Happy Friday. Byron, I want to get to you first, because I wanted to just have you talk straight to the American worker right now that is about to retire, that's watching the stocks and feeling a little iffy about all the news we got this week, and then hearing from the president that not only are these auto tariffs going into effect next week, but we may see even more tariffs on pharmaceuticals next. BYRON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT," """"THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER"""": Well", if you are looking at a 401(k) now you are pretty upset, probably. And you know that the losses that have happened the last few weeks will take a long time to get back. It's not going to pop back to where it was tomorrow. Now, what the president is doing is he has an idea. He has an idea of bringing jobs back, bringing more trade back to the United States and making a lot of money, as Peter Navarro just said. He has this idea, but it will take time. And the question is, is he strong of will enough to just keep doing this all the way as everybody screams about what's going on and some people actually are hurt economically? HASNIE: Meredith, I was talking to a Canadian this week. And they think, I think the perspective from their side is that this is also to weaken Canada to a point where it has to cave and eventually the U.S. takes over demand. MEREDITH MCGRAW," """"WALL STREET JOURNAL"""": Well", I think so much of how Trump and his team talks about trade is ultimately a big negotiating tactic and tool. But we are seeing how some of the uncertainties about what exactly Trump is going to implement next Wednesday on his so-called liberation day and exactly how they are going about enacting these tariffs has caused a lot of uncertainties with the markets, with consumers. We saw that University of Michigan consumer survey come out today showing that consumer confidence is at its lowest level since 2022. So, we're seeing real time reactions in the markets to Trump's trade policy, which, right now, we still haven't really seen clarity on. And we'll see what happens on Wednesday. HASNIE: I want to get to this breaking news just here. A judge just blocked the Trump administration firing the VOA, that's the Voice of America staff. So another legal injunction against the Trump administration, something they have been complaining about. Hans, I want to ask you, Capitol Hill Republicans are going to try go after these judges next week with duel hearings in the House and Senate, but there is really no appetite and probably not the votes to impeach any of these judges, so what can they do? HANS NICHOLS," """"AXIOS"""": The only remedy is impeachment. They can fulminate", they can jawbone, they can be upset about it. But in reality the president and the White House has had a very clear strategy on all these judges, and that is to say let's go all the way to the Supreme Court. When you look at a lot of the cases that they are testing, especially from the White House side, they know this is going to be decided by the Supremes. And yes, this is a negative ruling for them, and I suspect we're going to have a lot of them, and I suspect reporters like Meredith and myself are going to have to figure out every judge, who appointed them to what position at what stage of their career. But this whole idea that they are going to be Democratic judges that are going to stop Trump at the circuit court, district court level, could be true, right? I like to think of judges as just plain judges, not Democratic judges or Republican judges. But ultimately, they're going to get to the Supreme Court, and it has a conservative majority, which favors Trump. HASNIE: Everyone is watching what the vice president is doing right now with his wife Usha Vance in Greenland. I want you to help me unpack this right here. It kind of explains why he is in Greenland. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) J.D. VANCE, (R) VICE PRESIDENT: I think a lot of Americans wonder, why does Greenland matter so much? We know that Russia and China and other nations are taking an extraordinary interest in artic passageways and artic naval routes, and indeed in the minerals of the artic territories. We need to ensure that America is leading in the arctic, because we know that if America doesn't, other nations will fill the gap where we fall behind. (END VIDEO CLIP) HASNIE: Byron, it feels like someone has finally really laid it out and really carefully explained why the heck we would want to take Greenland. YORK: The importance to the United States, and Greenland has been important for a long time to the United States, is air lanes and sea lanes, and also the minerals that it has. We had an air force base for a long time and is now a space base there. And the United States is saying that Greenland -- excuse me, Denmark, which rules Greenland, is not doing enough to secure it. The active duty military of Denmark is smaller than the New York City Police Department. That's why we don't have a lot of faith in it. I want to get your take, all of you, on the DOGE interview we saw with Elon Musk and Bret Baier and, you know, all the employees at DOGE. What were your biggest takeaways? And I will go down the row here. YORK: My biggest takeaway was the incredible contrast between the sobriety and the seriousness of these men who are working on this and crazy 19-year- old gamers image we were getting in press coverage. HASNIE: Meredith? MCGRAW: I think, to Byron's point, so much of DOGE has been sort of shrouded in secrecy, it feels, to the public. And so seeing who some of these people are, how they are thinking through some of the decisions that they are making, and giving some real evidence for some of the allegations of fraud that they are seeing, too, I thought it was interesting to hear firsthand from them. HASNIE: Hans, did you feel like you walked away with any more questions? NICHOLS: A lot more questions, but a lot more understanding. DOGE is the most underreported and overreported story in Washington right now, which is to say every day on the front page of a newspaper there is something about DOGE, and, yet, we walk away from it really kind of on a choose your own adventure of what you want to believe about it. So that's why I thought this interview was important, because it laid out a lot of facts. It allowed them to talk about it. Bret pushed and had some questions. So ultimately when we look at the Trump administration, the Trump White House, how successful reforming government, this whole DOGE effort, is going to be one of his top three potential biggest, I don't want to say accomplishments, but challenges, and exceedingly important. HASNIE: Maybe they should just hire a press secretary that gets to the podium and does briefings every single day and maybe that would help. (LAUGHTER) YORK: Well, sometimes Elon Musk has been the victim of his own irrational exuberance, the chainsaw stuff and stuff like that. And when he was not really dominating it, it was a very impressive group of people. HASNIE: Thank you all for joining us on your Friday. Have a great weekend. And now, of course," it is Friday. And it's time for """"Notable Quotables."""" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Is the battle between government of decades and decades of buildup and business", which you guys are, is that like a train hitting each other? ELON MUSK, CEO, TESLA: It might be the biggest revolution in government since the original revolution. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Fire Elon Musk and save Elmo. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The old relationship we had with the United States is over. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He was one of the top members, but he is no longer tough because he is behind bars. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No one in your national security team would ever put anyone in danger. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is a -- of epic proportions. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Nobody is texting war plans. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you trust the secretary of defense or do you trust and anti-Trump sensationalist reporter? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No way having sat on this committee for nine years you can walk out of this room with this information and give it to whoever you want. DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: I think it's all a witch-hunt. BAIER: Senator Duckworth, you said Pete Hegseth is a f-ing liar. SEN. TAMMY DUCKWORTH, (D-IL): I am known to have a little bit of a potty mouth, unfortunately UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I know we've got governor hot wheels down there, come on, now. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right, but why won't you apologize? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I put out a statement. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That didn't have an apology in it. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You think me and Byron were playing basketball together, losing game. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's cold as -- in here. TRUMP: I will be known as the fertilization president. (END VIDEO TAPE) HASNIE: And maybe more. Monday, SPECIAL REPORT hits the road live from the Homeland Security Department. Bret will have an exclusive interview with DHS Secretary Kristi Noem.

A new wildfire in Southern California prompts evacuation orders. We'll bring you there. And who really is in control of the Panama Canal? Might be named the first 100 hours, President Trump is sending 1,500 active duty troops to the southern border. He wants them there by the end of the month. He's also moving forward with other elements of his immigration policy during a busy first week back in office. Senior White House Correspondent Peter Doocy starts us off live from the North Lawn. Good evening, Peter. PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. We've been reading through President Trump's latest executive order. He's using his authority under Article II of the Constitution to forbid anybody that makes it across the U.S. southern border illegally from staying. He is also now sitting down for his first interview as the 47th president. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Only the second time in history somebody didn't have consecutive terms. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Yes, well, they say it's historically bigger. DOOCY (voice over): And as promised, the president is closing the border, sending 1500 active duty U.S. troops to the border by the end of this month to join 2500 troops already there as part of an effort to repel, repatriate and remove illegal aliens. KAROLINE LEAVITT, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: President Trump is using every lever of his executive power to secure our nation's borders. This is the number one promise that he made to the American people on the campaign trail. DOOCY (voice over): President Trump is settling back into the Oval Office, a place J.D. Vance had never been. J.D. VANCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Wow. DOOCY: This is J.D. Vance's first time to step into the Oval Office. VANCE: This is incredible. DOOCY (voice over): Fox News was given an exclusive first look at the handwritten letter President Biden left for President Trump. It says, in part, I wish you and your family all the best in the next four years. May God bless you and guide you as he has blessed and guided our beloved country since our founding. Things are less civil between Elon Musk and one of the CEOs President Trump celebrated as part of the $500 billion A.I. project Stargate. Musk tweeted, they don't actually have the money. OpenAI's Sam Altman tried to take the high road, responding, I genuinely respect your accomplishments and inviting Musk, want to come visit the first site already under way. An unimpressed Musk later wrote, Sam is a swindler. The former president's last minute pardons for siblings are not sitting well with Democrats. Axios quotes, former Obama Chief of Staff Bill Daley is saying, it's disgusting. TRUMP: This guy went around giving everybody pardons. And you know, the funny thing, maybe the sad thing, is he didn't give himself a pardon. And if you look at it, it all had to do with him. (END VIDEOTAPE) DOOCY (on camera): And we're learning that one of the first bills President Trump will wind up signing since coming back to office, will be the Laken Riley Act, that is the one that deports illegal immigrants that get arrested for any reason.

Peter, thanks. You can see the entire interview with President Trump tonight on Hannity, 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time. The Justice Department is directing prosecutors to investigate state and local officials who may try to thwart the president's new immigration and border policy. Correspondent David Spunt has details tonight. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The Department of Justice moving full steam ahead, enacting President Trump's efforts to curb illegal immigration. Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove, Trump's former personal defense attorney sending this memo obtained by Fox News to DOJ attorneys across the country. Bove warns them to carry out the Trump immigration agenda or face consequences. He writes in part, it is the responsibility of the Justice Department to defend the Constitution and accordingly, to lawfully execute the policies that the American people elected President Trump to implement and all 93 U.S. Attorney offices shall investigate incidents involving any such misconduct for potential prosecution, including for obstructing federal functions. Meaning, investigate local and state officials if they do not comply with DOJ orders. Local officials are already pushing back. ROB BONTA, CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL: Very expected. No surprise, another scare tactic from the federal administration. We are very well aware of what the law requires us to do and what it permits us to do. We have strong states rights under the 10th Amendment of the United States Constitution. SPUNT (voice over): The memo was part of a larger push for the DOJ to focus on immigration related matters. Earlier this week, multiple top officials overseeing the immigration court system across the country were pushed out of their positions. (END VIDEOTAPE) SPUNT (on camera): Bret, this memo also calls for quarterly reports from U.S. attorneys offices back here to main justice on the status and statistics of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and removals. Bret. BAIER: Thanks, David. Only one of President Trump's cabinet nominees has been confirmed by the Senate so far. Secretary of State Marco Rubio sworn in yesterday. Transportation Secretary Nominee Sean Duffy was voted out of committee today. Senate Majority Leader John Thune was forced to file cloture to break filibusters from the Democrats on four other nominees. That delays confirmation votes for at least another day, likely into the weekend. Now, committees have held hearings for eight other nominees. The Judiciary Committee is expected to vote on Pam Bondi's nomination for attorney general, January 29th. At least four other committee hearings are scheduled, including next week's hearings to consider Kash Patel as FBI director, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as HHS Secretary. Hearings for other potential key positions have not even been scheduled yet due to paperwork and background check delays, they say, in part to recent snow days. We'll see about that. The Senate has been slower moving on recent -- than in recent years to confirm nominees. At this point in the Bush administration, President Bush had 2000 -- in 2001 had seven officials confirmed. Former President Obama had nine. President Trump, the first time around, had two in his first term. Former President Biden had one. To speed up this process, President Trump has at least expressed interest in recess appointments if, if they're needed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. President, is it also true in your conversations with Republicans today that you asked them to consider recess appointments for cabinet officials? TRUMP: I think, if it's needed. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Now, if President Trump were to try to make recess appointments, here's how that could happen. The House would have to adjourn, formally adjourn, pass a resolution. The Senate would have to take up an adjournment resolution. If it fails, which it would, President Trump could argue that there's a disagreement between the House and Senate, paving the way for him to adjourn both chambers and make his recess appointments. Now, the process could continue. It can continue hearings and confirmations, but the recess appointments could go for two years. It's never been used like that before. It would likely be legally challenged, but it's Article Two, Section Three of the Constitution allows this process to go forward, spells out this very process, so that is a possibility. The House and Senate has to be in recess. Have to both be in recess for longer than 10 days to make recess appointments. If we look at the legislative calendar, the blue is the House only in recess. The yellow is both of them. The Senate has no extended recess dates on the schedule until mid-March. However, the house will take its first week long recess next week. But again, one chamber needs to vote officially to adjourn. And whether the House would even do that, or had the votes to do that, is up in the air. As we mentioned earlier, Senate Majority Leader John Thune is threatening to keep his colleagues working throughout the weekend after Democrats delayed confirmation votes for three of President Trump's nominees so far, and it could be a rocky road for another one tonight. Senior National Correspondent Aishah Hasnie has details tonight from Capitol Hill. AISHAH HASNIE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Bret, good evening to you. Fox is told tonight that at least three Republican senators could vote no on Pete Hegseth, the Defense Secretary nominee, and that's Mitch McConnell, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski. Possible nos, and that would mean that Vice President J.D. Vance would have to come back here to the Senate and break a tie. But first, Senate has to get through another nominee who is tied up in what Republicans are calling a Democrat delay tactic. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SEN. JOHN BARRASSO (R-WY): Democrats chose last minute obstruction. HASNIE (voice over): Tonight, a full-fledged battle is underway in the Senate over President Trump's nominees, Democrat Senator Chris Murphy holding up a vote for CIA director pick John Radcliffe, by enforcing the 30 hour debate rule. SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): This debate time this day gives all of my colleagues the time to carefully review the record. HASNIE (voice over): But the Senate Intelligence Committee, which Murphy does not sit on, already debated Radcliffe's qualifications. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I voted for Radcliffe. HASNIE (voice over): And all but three Democrats voted with Republicans to send him to a confirmation vote. SEN. TOM COTTON (R-AR): Senator Schumer stood here yesterday talking about how we cooperate on highly qualified, capable nominees with integrity. HASNIE (voice over): A source familiar tells Fox News, Republicans believed they had an agreement on confirming Radcliffe with Democrat Leader Chuck Schumer and that Murphy may be going rogue. The delay means Trump's other nominees may not be taken up until at least the weekend. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This can be easy or this can be hard. HASNIE (voice over): On Tuesday, President Trump asked Senate Majority Leader John Thune and speaker Johnson about recess appointments, forcing the House and Senate to adjourn so that he can swiftly appoint all of his nominees. The move would blow up the Senate's advice and consent process, and a senior GOP source says the House is not interested in a journey. Even some of Trump's biggest supporters in the Senate say it's not time for the nuclear option yet. SEN. MIKE LEE (R-UT): I don't know that we're at a point where that's even being discussed. I think everybody involved would prefer to just get them done the regular way. (END VIDEOTAPE) HASNIE (on camera): So, Bret, if this delay goes on and on and on, then this is what the vote schedule would look like. We would see a Radcliffe final confirmation vote tomorrow, a Hegseth final confirmation vote sometime late Friday, and then Kristi Noem's final confirmation vote sometime over the weekend, or even bleed into next week. Again, it's drip, drip, drip, something that President Trump does not want, Bret. BAIER: Aishah Hasnie live on the Hill. Aishah, thank you. The founder of the political group Oath Keepers, visited Capitol Hill today. Stewart Rhodes appearance came after President Trump commuted his 18 year prison sentence. Rhodes was convicted in one of the most serious cases brought by the Justice Department over the Capitol riot of January 6th, 2021, his commutation was part of about 1500 such actions by the new president. Tech stocks lifted Wall Street toward another positive day, the Dow gaining 131, the S&P 500 was up 37, the NASDAQ surged 253 today. Unfortunately, a new wildfire to report in Southern California, forcing another round of evacuations out there. Correspondent Christina Coleman is in Santa Clarita tonight, with the latest. Good evening, Christina. CHRISTINA COLEMAN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Hi, good evening, Bret. A giant plume of smoke can be seen for miles as this fast moving fire continues to spread. Just go ahead and take a look behind me. You could see that that is what people are seeing all over L.A. County. The Hughes fire broke out today around 11:00 a.m. Pacific Time, north of Los Angeles and Santa Clarita near Castaic Lake. The Fire exploded from 50 acres to more than 5,000 acres just within an hour or two, it is currently zero percent contained. The crews with the Los Angeles County Fire Department and Angeles National Forest are battling this wind driven fire that officials say is burning in very dry brush. The fire has prompted evacuation orders for tens of thousands of people, including local schools and a nearby detention center that is currently evacuating hundreds of inmates to a different part of the facility. Officials urging residents not to wait as gusty Santa Ana winds fueled the flames at just over 30 miles per hour. Drivers trying to avoid the Hughes fire are running into major gridlock on the five freeway and surrounding roads. The California Highway Patrol closing down a major portion of that interstate. And this new fire has erupted as crews continue to battle the deadly Palisades and Eaton fires, they've gained a lot of ground on that. But as you can see, we're still dealing with these dry, gusty conditions, and more fires are breaking out, Bret. BAIER: Bad news. Christina, thank you. Up next, keeping up with President Trump's first days of his second presidency is not so easy. Lot happening. That with Brit Hume coming up. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) URSULA VON DER LEYEN, PRESIDENT, EUROPEAN COMMISSION: We have entered a new era of harsh geo strategic competition. 400 million Latin Americans will soon be engaged in a privileged partnership with 450 million Europeans. We will need to work together to avoid a global race to the bottom. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: E.U. Commission president not so veiled threat about a possible trade war with the U.S. Meantime, the headlines are all about drinking from the fire hose; full throttle for Trump's promised upheaval; business navigates Trump's ticket of orders; E.U. tells Trump's America: We have other options. Reacting to the headline that Trump delivers fresh tariff threats against the E.U. and China, and that is coming out as using those tariff threats are real with this president. Let's bring in Fox News chief political analyst Brit Hume. Brit, good evening. What about this and the reaction from different countries? Some are acting differently to everything that President Trump is saying. BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I think the way Trump operates, and we've seen this time and again, Bret, is he makes a maximalist demand or threat, and you've seen it over and over again. He's going to impose these tariffs, he prepared to -- you know, he's prepared to use the military to do that. He is -- and this is the way he always operates. And we have seen it again and again. He -- once he is done that. And here is a reaction, he negotiate from there. And he will very often settle for less than his original demand. I mean, now, you know, he is talking about annexing Greenland, the taking over charge of the Panama Canal. My guess is that true to form, he would settle for some adjustments down on the Panama Canal to alleviate worries about China's influence there, and he would probably end up settling for new arrangements with Greenland that further our interests there. That's sort of how he operates. And so, I think the people in the E.U. are all worked up about a big trade war. But let this thing play out a little bit and see what happens. BAIER: Yes, a lot of business leaders are quoted in various media outlets, saying tariffs are horrible, will be horrible for the American people, but a popular CEO on Wall Street, JPMorgan Chase Jamie Dimon said this in Davos. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN, JPMORGAN CHASE: I look at tariffs, they are an economic tool. That's it. They're an economic weapon. You know, depending how you use it and why use it, stuff like that. And, you know, people argue is it inflationary non-inflationary? I would put in perspective if it's a little inflationary, but it's good for national security, so be it. I mean, get over it. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Get over it, he says, Brit. And listen, the fast and furious executive orders. There are now businesses and banks like JPMorgan Chase that have whole departments that are trying to digest the impact as it's coming at us in these first days. HUME: Well, they are, and with good reason, because he is obviously trying -- we're seeing it happening kind of before our eyes in the federal government to dismantle the government's DEI bureaucracy. And if that -- and if that unfolds and as new policies put in place by his executive orders toward this issue come into play, these companies that have these big departments of diversity, equity, and inclusion, and, you know, we're very well-paid staff and all that, they are going to have to deal with that because they're not going to need them anymore. And in fact, it'd probably e impermissible for them to have them. So, they have got work to do, and I guess they're setting about doing it'll keep lawyers busy for a while. I'm sure of that, Bret. BAIER: And journalists too. Brit, as always, thank you. Up next, Secretary of State Rubio's on the job and shaking things up the state department and beyond. We'll have a live report from there. First, ""BEYOND OUR BORDERS"" tonight. Yemen's Houthi rebels say they have released the crew of the vehicle carrier sized in -- carrier -- a vehicle carrier, seized in November of 2023 at the start of their campaign in the Red Sea corridor. The rebels say they freed the sailors after mediation by Oman. Today, President Trump redesignated the Houthis as a terror organization. China's navy commissions a new generation frigate, as competition rises with the U.S. and other regional powers. Beijing says the ship will play a vital role in enhancing the overall combat effectiveness of its forces. China already has the world's largest Navy in terms of the number of hulls, although its technology is sometimes seen as lagging. And this is a live look at Dublin. Dublin, Ireland, courtesy of EarthCam. One of the big stories there tonight. Veteran politician, Micheal Martin becomes Ireland's prime minister for a second time. Lawmakers formally approved him as head of a coalition government. The confirmation comes almost two months after an election in which Martin's won the vote -- the most seats, but not enough to govern alone. Just some of the other stories ""BEYOND OUR BORDERS"" tonight. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Police say a male student at Nashville High School killed a female student, injured another, and then, killed himself today. Antioch High School is about 10 miles southeast of downtown Nashville. Today's incident comes nearly two years after a shooter opened fire at a separate Nashville private elementary school, killing six people, including three children. ""FOX WEATHER ALERT"" now. Much of the South digging out from what is being called the worst winter storm in more than 120 years. New Orleans had eight inches of snow. Florida broke its record for largest snow storm ever. Life threatening cold is expected to keep the snow pack in place through at least the end of the week. Tonight, as mentioned with Brit Hume, the heads of federal agencies and departments are under orders to close all Diversity Equity and Inclusion offices. DEI. The Federal Office of Personnel Management, gave those leaders until the end of the business day today. They were told to place government workers in those offices on paid leave, at least for the time being. The nation's new top diplomat, already beginning some major changes to the state department. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, following President Trump's playbook, criticizing the previous administration's emphasis on ideology and social reform. Senior national correspondent Rich Edson is at the state department tonight. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Secretary of State Marco Rubio is laying out the department's second stint with America first. MARCO RUBIO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: There will be changes, but the changes are not meant to be destructive. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Congratulations, Mr. Secretary. (APPLAUSE) EDSON: Within hours of his swearing in, Rubio sent a cable to employees detailing the first steps of President Trump's foreign policy overhaul, eliminating symbols of domestic political issues and posts abroad, and reversing climate change policies. Rubio says the department will no longer facilitate mass migration, and that now, quote, ""Our diplomatic relations will prioritize securing America's borders, stopping illegal and destabilizing migration, and negotiating the repatriation of illegal immigrants."" In line with President Trump's executive orders, Rubio says the State Department will eliminate DEI programs and offices. At the start of the Biden administration, then Secretary Antony Blinken created a new chief diversity and inclusion officer at State. Blinken asked each bureau to designate one official to oversee diversity and inclusion efforts. The top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee says, quote, ""DEI programs were implemented to give Americans of all background a fair opportunity to serve our nation. Implementing an executive order to rescind these programs is un-American and shameful."" Secretary Rubio has also been asked to comment on domestic issues like the president's January 6th related pardons. RUBIO: We're going to focus on what makes America stronger and more prosperous and safer. I'm not going to engage in domestic political debates. (END VIDEO TAPE) EDSON (on camera): This afternoon President Trump did a little foreign policy on Truth Social, threatening Russia with tariffs, taxes, or sanctions if they refuse to end their war or cut a deal on the war on Ukraine. The U.S. and allies hit Russia with a number of sanctions after it invaded three years ago. Bret? BAIER: Rich Edson live at the State Department. Rich, thank you. President Trump insists China is operating the Panama Canal. He says the U.S. needs to regain control down there. Tonight, chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin takes a closer look who is really in charge in a vital geopolitical region. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Panama's government began auditing a Hong Kong company operating ports at both ends of the Panama Canal after President Trump expressed concerns over growing Chinese influence over the canal. DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: And we're taking it back. GRIFFIN: Panama's president, Jose Mulino, was asked about Trump's remarks and the potential for U.S. invasion. JOSE RAUL MULINO, PRESIDENT OF PANAMA: Be serious, be serious. GRIFFIN: The Panamanian government submitted a letter of complaint to the U.N. Security Council rejecting President Trump's claims to the Panama Canal, saying it violated the U.N. charter. U.S. officials have warned China may be eyeing the canal through which 40 percent of U.S. container ships traverse each year. The former head of U.S. Southern Command General Laura Richardson had this warning during the Biden administration. GEN. LAURA RICHARDSON (RET), FORMER SOUTHCOM COMMANDER: I worry about the, you know, they look like civilian companies, or state owned enterprises, and could be quickly changed over to a military capability if they needed that to. GRIFFIN: At his confirmation hearing last week, the new secretary of state, Marco Rubio, clarified what the president was referring to when he said China is, quote, operating the canal. RUBIO: Sovereignty over the canal has not been turned over to a foreign power. In reality, a foreign power today possesses, through their companies, the ability to turn the canal into a choke point in a moment of conflict, and that is a direct threat to the national interest and security of the United States. (END VIDEO TAPE) GRIFFIN (on camera): From 2017 to 2023, the U.S. did not have an ambassador in Panama. During those five years, Panama signed 47 bilateral agreements with the Chinese, agreed the China's Belt and Road Initiative, and severed ties with Taiwan, succumbing to pressure from Beijing, Bret. BAIER: And Jen, domestically, what are we learning about troops heading to the southern border? GRIFFIN: The biggest difference, we're told, is these troops will be armed and are deploying with full combat capability. The marines are treating this deployment as they would any other emergency contingency, evacuating an embassy, deploying to a war zone. As one marine involved in the planning put it, our response will be immediate. We are going in ready to respond. If the cartels shoot at us, we will not stand by. Bret? BAIER: We are watching that closely. Jennifer Griffin live at the Pentagon. Jennifer, thank you. Up next, we take out to very first sanctuary city. And later, the panel on another busy day in the Trump administration, we'll take a look at some of the latest actions. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: The Trump administration seeking to end some research on viruses. It's the same research many experts and Republican lawmakers have blamed for the COVID-19 pandemic. ""Wall Street Journal"" reporting at this hour the order aims to stop scientists with U.S. funding from conducting gain of function research that could endanger human health. President Trump is threatening to cut federal funding to sanctuary cities. His border czar has talked about jailing leaders who shield immigrants. Senior correspondent Claudia Cowan reports from Berkeley, California, where the sanctuary movement began more than 50 years ago. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) CLAUDIA COWAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: The birthplace of the free speech movement is also the nation's first sanctuary city. Berkeley, California has been shielding conscientious objectors, asylum seekers, and illegal immigrants for decades. It began in 1971 when Berkeley gave safe haven to a group of American sailors who did not want to be sent to Vietnam. BENJAMIN GONZALEZ O'BRIEN, SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY: They did not want to be deployed for combat, and so they sought safe harbor. These places of faith in Berkeley offered that safe harbor. That leads the city to pass the first sanctuary resolution. COWAN: A decade later religious leaders protected people they argued were fleeing political persecution in El Salvador and Guatemala, what the federal government said were economic refugees. After that, Berkeley's sanctuary model took off. San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, and other blue cities began to adopt policies reducing or even prohibiting cooperation with federal immigration officials. City leaders said it was a way to foster trust with local law enforcement and assure immigrants who reported crimes wouldn't be deported. After the September 11th attacks sparked concerns about national security, federal authorities ramped up efforts to detain and deport people here illegally. In response, some sanctuary cities doubled down and added additional protections for immigrants. With President Donald Trump vowing mass deportations, Berkeley is once again at the forefront. ADENA ISHII, (D) BERKELEY, CALIFORNIA, MAYOR: I feel it's my responsibility to reassure our residents that they are safe here. COWAN: Passing a resolution last night to reaffirm its sanctuary status and seal its far-reaching legacy. (END VIDEO TAPE) COWAN (on camera): Today, more than 560 cities, counties, and states have passed sanctuary policies in defiance of federal immigration law. Bret? BAIER: Claudia Cowan live in Berkeley. Claudia, thanks. Professional golf season is underway. Play began at the Farmers Insurance open today in La Jolla, California. The PGA tour will once again exist in the same universe as the LIV tour which is owned in part by a Saudi Arabian investment fund. The tours are said to be working toward a merger. Tonight, golfer Phil Mickelson says he thinks the two leagues can complement each other. He spoke on FOX Business earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PHIL MICKELSON, PROFESSIONAL GOLFER: We are trying to become an add value to the golf ecosystem, let's say. And as the old model was not getting the younger players involved, it wasn't a global model. The PGA tour has done a great job for many, many years, but it's kind of a national, U.S.-centric based model, where we're much more global. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: FOX Sports will broadcast the LIV tour's 14 tournament schedule this season beginning next month. Up next, the panel on pardons and delayed confirmations. First, here's what a couple of our FOX affiliates around the country are covering tonight. FOX 19 in Cincinnati as indictments against four Chilean men accused of targeting multimillion dollars homes reveal a possible connection to the break-in at the residents of Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow. Troopers reportedly found some items suspected to have been stolen from Burrow's house in a search of the suspect's vehicle during a traffic stop. And this is a live look at New York. One of the big stories there from FOX 5, our affiliate, Governor Kathy Hochul announces legislation to ban smartphones in schools. It would take effect next school year. It would force students to disconnect from their phones and other personal devices while at school. The proposal would require approval from legislators. New Jersey is looking at it, too. That's tonight's live look outside the beltway from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back. (MUSIC) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Breaking tonight, we have been talking about the fast and furious pace of what's happening in the Trump administration part two. Just now, the Justice Department freezes all civil rights cases, including police investigations. We're confirming that the Justice Department ordered its civil rights division to halt any litigation leftover from the Biden administration and not pursue any new cases or settlements. We don't know what this means for big cases that were already underway or some reform agreements that had been finalized in recent months, but right now we are confirming the Justice Department is freezing all litigation leftover from the Biden administration when it comes to civil rights. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: We had a great first term, but we're going to have an even better second term. And I think we're going to do things that people would be shocked at. REP. PETE AGUILAR (D-CA), HOUSE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS CHAIR: Republicans have failed to show us that they are interested in doing anything that helps working families. REP. LISA MCCLAIN (R-MI), HOUSE REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE CHAIR: Democrats don't know what to do. My message to them is that it's not too late to join us in restoring America. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: As we said, a lot of things happening all at once. We are digesting it all. Meantime, Sean Hannity sat down with the commander-in-chief in the Oval Office. Among other things, what it was like to go back into that office again the second time. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: I felt that we shouldn't have had necessarily be here, could have been done. A lot of work could have been -- it would have been over. We wouldn't have inflation. We wouldn't have had the Afghanistan disaster. We wouldn't have October 7th with Israel where so many people were killed. And you wouldn't have a Ukraine war going on. But, with all that being said, I think it's bigger. It's bigger than if it were more traditional.

 they say it's historically bigger. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: You can see that interview tonight, 9:00 p.m. eastern time. Let's bring in our panel, Katie Pavlich, news editor at Townhall.com, Annie Linskey," White House reporter for """"The Wall Street Journal""""", and Democratic campaign consultant Kevin Walling. OK, confirmations, this is really what is being slowed down in the process. Democrats," this is """"Punch Bowl"," """"Thune threatens weekend votes as Democrats stall Trump cabinet picks. Tuesday's proceedings were a preview of how difficult it will be for GOP leaders to expeditiously confirm the rest of Trump's national security nominees. Democrats' delay tactics could prompt Trump to push more aggressively for recess appointments"," something the president mentioned during his Tuesday meeting with Thune and Speaker Johnson."""" It's a process if they want to do that. And I rolled through it earlier in the show. But it may take a long time. KATIE PAVLICH", FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, the Senate has a legitimate role of advise and consent. But Democrats are breaking another norm here. It is perfectly normal for nominees to move over in a decent, timely fashion. Under President Trump, Democrats decided they wanted to start playing games with delay tactics. Getting these nominees confirmed not just at the cabinet level, but at ambassador levels, undersecretary levels during the first term, and then it appears they are trying to do it again as Republicans have a 53-seat majority. Now, for President Trump's part in this, he wants these people in place because personnel is policy. He signed a lot of executive orders this week, but in order for those things to get put into place, and for things to start getting done, you have to have people in charge of these agencies, especially when it comes to Homeland Security, the intelligence agencies, for these things to get put in place for some results to happen quickly so they can move onto the next problem. BAIER: How did Democrats push back on this? What did they say in defense of this, Kevin? KEVIN WALLING, DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGN CONSULTANT: Yes, Bret, I think, as you rightly pointed out at the outset of the show, we're one for one right now in terms the timing of where Joe Biden was with his cabinet as where Donald Trump is. And you have Democrats that have raised some serious concerns about some of these nominees, and the process should play out. You have a delay, also, too, in the Senate itself in terms of processing some of these paperwork, as you pointed out, responding to questions from senators, responding to the FBI background check. So I think Democrats are picking and choosing where they can effectively push back on some of these concerns with some of these characters like RFK, maybe Pete Hegseth, Tulsi Gabbard, and others. BAIER: Yes, well, you have John Ratcliffe that comes out of committee at 14 to three and, yet, he's held up. So Annie, you know covering the White House, President Trump is about moving things quickly. There is going to be a point where this collision happens, where it's February and there is only a few. ANNIE LINSKEY," """"WALL STREET JOURNAL"""": Yes", yes. And you know," I would also like it point out that """"The Washington Post"""" editorial page", which is not exactly friendly to the right, came out and had thumbs up for almost all of the Trump's pick, saying, you know, presidents do get to pick their own person. And I spent a lot of time on Monday at the White House, and you are absolutely right about that energy. There is a sense of, like, go, go, go. And it was a distinct change from the last administration. So, I think you can sort of read into some of Trump's comments this week that he is trying to keep that fire under the senators, and you see Thune responding to it. BAIER: Yes. Meantime, immigration really the biggest impact, perhaps. We're seeing a lot of arrests already, according to Tom Homan, the border czar. DOJ has been instructed to investigate state or local officials who obstruct immigration enforcement," """"In the memo", the acting deputy attorney general, Trump's former defense attorney," outlines interim decisions and policy changes pending the confirmation of Trump's nominee for U.S. attorney general Pam Bondi. He said interim changes are necessary as initial response to Trump's executive orders regarding three of the most serious threats facing the American people."""" In other words", if you stand in the way, we may come after you. PAVLICH: This is something that Tom Homan has been threatening for months after President Trump was elected, and Pam Bondi, the former attorney general of Florida potentially likely to get confirmed to the attorney general of the United States, has a lot of experience when it comes to this issue, when it comes to working with local law enforcement to take on violent illegal immigrant criminals inside these cities. And when it comes to officials, you are seeing this break where you have some Democrats, like New York City Mayor Eric Adams, for example, wanting to work with the federal government to get these people out of their communities. But then you have Brandon Johnson, the mayor of Chicago, saying he is going to do everything he can to stop federal immigration authorities from coming into their local jails and their cities, and he will oppose them. And that is actually in violation of federal law, to harbor or help illegal immigrants evade arrest. So Tom Homan has said quite bluntly they are willing to charge these people who do that, including very high profile politicians. BAIER: How far are those politicians, do you think, willing to go, Kevin? Some of the Democrats talking one way, but going to jail? WALLING: I think some of them. Some of them are very passionate about this particular issue. Katie mentioned some of those, J.B. Pritzker, for example, the governor of Illinois, has staked out quite a bit on this issue. I think it's -- my advice to Democrats as a Democrat is to work with this president where we can. We just passed the Laken Riley Act, bipartisan in the House. BAIER: It got 46 Democrats -- WALLING: It was 46 Democrats, similar numbers of terms of the Senate, I think 10 Democrats joined there. Where there are commonsense policies, similar to what we tried to pass in the Senate with that bipartisan immigration bill, let's do that. But you are going to see some Democrats, I think, on the left side of my party really stand up and make a name for themselves pushing back on some of these policies. BAIER: To make a name for themselves. But they can't look at the election results and say this is what I read from that, can they? WALLING: Certainly. The same people that elected Brandon Johnson, for example, in Chicago by a large majority, the suburbs of Illinois not so much for the Democrats. But, again, you have that play-by-play with the same constituents represented by both the president and fairly left wing Democrats. BAIER: Annie? LINSKEY: Yes. No, I think writ large, it would be very difficult to look at the election results and come away thinking that Democrats have the right message and the right policy on immigration that resonating with the country writ large. You did see the Biden administration move in the very end of the administration towards a more centrist position. And I think that's -- that's certainly a view that even within the White House people had been hoping the president would have gotten to that conclusion a lot sooner. And you might have had a different -- a different -- not necessarily a different result, but I think it maybe would have been closer. I think Democrats really look at that election, and immigration is one reason where they realize they need to do better. WALLING: Amen. BAIER: The pardon and commutations of the January 6th rioters has really gotten a lot of media attention. The president has been asked about it, I think six times over the last two days, has answered every time. But the reaction continues to come. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JAMIE RASKIN, (D-MD) HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: It's absolutely outrageous that the president would pardon en masse such a dangerous group of people. REP. MIKE JOHNSON, (R-LA) HOUSE SPEAKER: Everybody can describe this however they want. The president has the pardon and commutation authority. The president has made his decision. I don't second guess those. REP. TED LIEU, (D-CA) HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: What the current president did in pardoning these folks who assaulted police officers was massively disrespectful to law enforcement. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: And Katie, he has explained it numerous times, saying they served three years. He believed, the president believed that those sentences were over-the-top. But he is still answering questions about it. PAVLICH: Still answering questions about it. And I think you have to have a lot of context behind the pardoning here. You have to go back years of leading up to this moment, back to 2020, the riots then. And the Biden administration came in, dropped a lot of the charges against violent rioters who were assaulting federal agents, courthouses across the country, for example. And then you have the way the Justice Department handled a lot of these cases where they were taking U.S. attorneys and prosecutors off of very serious child trafficking cases all over the country to go after very minor misdemeanors, trying to turn them into felonies, and really putting all the resources at DOJ on this project, not discerning crime versus crime. And so there is a lot of context to that decision, and I think that both sides are trying to get a clean slate so everyone can move forward when it comes to these pardons on this issue. BAIER: And I don't think we are done, Annie. I think there were two pardons or commutations of D.C. police officers. Tonight, I think the pro- life group that was spending time in jail that's likely going to see that as well? LINSKEY: Yes, the president is clearly very eager to use his clemency powers. And you saw the outgoing president using his clemency powers. BAIER: Which is also under criticism. LINSKEY: Which is also under criticism. I think in both cases, there is a similarity of a lack of confidence in the Department of Justice. And to me, at least, that was one common message that came from both sides of pardons. BAIER: All right, panel, thanks so much. WALLING: Thanks, Bret. BAIER: And finally tonight, a special day. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (LAUGHTER) (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: A pastor of Saint Catherine of Siena Church just outside New Orleans took advantage of the winter weather by battling three nuns in snowball fight. The pastor put up a valiant fight, but then the nuns just destroyed him, ultimately sent him running, the pastor, for cover. Good job, nuns. Meanwhile, in the heart of the city, a former minor league hockey player Jay Croop showed off skills on frozen Canal Street which he was using as own personal hockey rink. Do you not see that in New Orleans that much. Stopped for a beignet after a while. Tomorrow on SPECIAL REPORT, the Senate showdown over President Trump's cabinet nominees, what comes next, how long will it take?

"Interview with Lt. Col. Darin Gaub, retired Black Hawk helicopter pilot",2025-01-30T00:00:00Z,"Steve Doocy, Brian Kilmeade, Lawrence Jones, Ainsley Earhardt","FOX AND FRIENDS 6:00 AM EST Lt. Col. Darin Gaub Fox News, FOX AND FRIENDS6:00 AM EST, NEWS; International, 1492words",U.S. Federal; Dist. of Columbia; International,"STEVE DOOCY, FOX NEWS HOST: Let's bring in retired Black Hawk helicopter pilot, Lieutenant Colonel Darin Gaub joins us right now. Lieutenant Colonel, thank you very much for joining us. LT. COL. DARIN GAUB, RETIRED BLACK HAWK HELICOPTER PILOT: Hey, good morning. Obviously wish under different circumstances. DOOCY: Yes, no kidding. We've been trying to figure out why it appears that the Black Hawk just essentially flew into the plane that was on final approach. About a half an hour ago, we had Michael Waltz, a national security guy on, and he said, one of the things they're going to have to look at is whether or not the pilots were wearing night goggles, night vision goggles. Because night vision goggles, I know they affect your depth of field, but they probably also affect what you can see around you, right? GAUB: That's true. It takes your normal field of vision. From what you see normally to down to about a 40-degree, and that affects each pilot in the front. And when you have one crew chief on the back in the back, you essentially got one side of the aircraft where a good chunk of it you cannot see beyond part of the sidewall. So, it's a relevant point to know whether or not they went unaided, which is just basic night flying, or under night vision goggles. But I will say that one of the concerns here too, based on just purely from the video that I saw, that everybody here is also seeing, the question is, there's an air corridor going down the Potomac River that defines exactly where they're supposed to fly by altitude and by left and right limits. If they went too high, that's a possibility that they could run into an aircraft that way. Now, these are all hypotheticals. That's one of the scenarios I can see explaining what happened. And I guess it remains to be seen based on what the radar says and what the transcripts say from the tapes from the tower what exactly was going on with that aircraft, if we will ever know, because a Black Hawk like that does not have. The cockpit voice recorder and other black box type things that people are used to hearing about. This is going to have to rely on external sources and witnesses to piece together. BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS HOST: So you're usually four crew members on those Black Hawks, right? In what circumstances are there only three? Do these Black Hawk, these crew members, does one look out one side and one look out the other side? And if they are down a person, could that have been the blind spot? GAUB: You know, anything's on the table right now when it comes to that. And that is certainly a possibility that could have influenced this. I don't really know yet for sure, but there are normally two crew chiefs in back, both looking sideways, 90 degrees off from the front two pilots. And each one of them is a set of eyes that can see a whole lot more in some cases than the pilots can. If you're down to three -- which is normal, by the way, for a training mission, that is not at all unusual. That one side has less eyes looking out and looking for other aircraft or obstacles than you would have with four. The Black Hawk is legal to fly with just two pilots. That is rarely ever done. Three of them in three total crew and training would be absolutely normal. Four is considered a fully combat mission capable aircraft, regardless of flight environment. LAWRENCE JONES, FOX NEWS HOST: So, Colonel, we just had the national security adviser, Michael Waltz, on earlier and immediately in my mind when they were talking about being a training exercise, where did these guys have experience or not, and they did. They were fully experienced. And my mind just go, probably two months ago, I was in a Black Hawk, they stress safety. Now, that was the aircraft that had four individuals. There are two airmen as and two pilots there. Does that concern you in this moment that they're so well trained that an oversight like this? Is this just a freak accident? GAUB: Well, again, that's certainly a possibility, because there are just so many questions that remain to be answered over the coming days and potentially even weeks. But I think one of the things that you hit on there is critical for everybody to understand is the training aspect of Army aviation pilots. You leave flight school. And you know quite a bit. You gain experience and you realize just how much you don't know. But I've sent many pilots from my command to the Fort Belvoir flight detachment supporting the Washington D.C. area and you send your best because of what it takes, you know, to thrive there. JONES: Yes. GAUB: And they went -- by the way, they had to go through training and get certified by a trainer to even fly in the airspace. You don't just go there and start flying, that you have to be trained and certified and ready and signed off by somebody saying they're ready to go out and do the admissions. AINSLEY EARHARDT, FOX NEWS HOST: That's why it's so bizarre, because this is the busiest runway in America. You need that extra training. Air traffic control was right there. This is the military, the most experienced people, the collision warning systems. Although we're learning from your friend, Steve, that maybe a Black Hawk doesn't have that on there. And then there was more than one pilot. So, if there is an emergency, the other guy takes over. So, we can't rule out pilot error. We can't rule out air traffic control error. The collision warning system, why don't the Black Hawks have that and why don't they have a black box? Is it because in times of war, we don't want to leave anything behind? GAUB: Well, one of them is this model of aircraft is quite a bit older and to put something like that in, it would have had been part of the initial package and that just -- that didn't really exist when they started making these. And it's a risk calculation to for what you install for the space you have. Second of all, the footage collision avoidance and warning systems in a Black Hawk, most of the time when Black Hawks fly, when I ran an assault battalion, you put ten aircraft in formation flying close together, close to the ground. You have a collision avoidance system. It's going to be constantly going off because you're always close to something. So, it just doesn't make any sense to put in this model of a helicopter in the first place. DOOCY: Let me ask you one other thing, Colonel, and that is given the fact that, you know, some of the flight patterns are classified, given the Pentagon's right there, the White House is right there as well, and all sorts of national security interests, for the most part, we know, the part we know about, is that they generally fly up and down the river. It's more complicated flying over, you know, a river at night when there are no lights on the river. So, you really -- with the exception of the altimeter, you really don't -- it's hard to place yourself, where am I in the sky. GAUB: Well, that's true to an extent. And I would say one of the biggest mitigating circumstances to that in this environment is the fact that when you fly in an environment that is so lit up with city lights, and you also then blend in aircraft lights and many aircraft flying, it can actually all kind of blend together. And at certain altitudes, you actually can have a difficult time differentiating between an aircraft with its lights on and cars on the streets and streetlights and things like that. I've had that happen to me in Korea where I hit a near miss from a 747 because you couldn't see it. It was just lights moving and we thought they were cars on the street. So, all of these are hypotheticals that could factor into a final conclusion someday in the future. JONES: So, Colonel, just taking all your experience and you don't have all the information, but you looking at the video, like average day Americans, when you take your experience, what immediately comes to mind just looking at that video? GAUB: Why didn't he turn? Why didn't he even slow down? Something caused him to not see that aircraft or to mistake the other aircraft on takeoff for thinking that was the one they were talking about. And that is always a possibility that they've mistaken something. So, I would just like to know, is there an answer to the question of why they didn't as deviate from their flight course at all, speed or altitude? KILMEADE: Because for what you know about the plane, it really couldn't have done much, right? GAUB: Correct. DOOCY: It sounds, Colonel, like you're getting a message from somebody. They're probably telling you, hey, you're on T.V. right now. Sir, thank you -- GAUB: Well, no. I think what they're doing is there's other channels that want Black Hawk pilots apparently and I've been on call next. EARHARDT: Just stick with Fox. DOOCY: We had you first. All right, Darin, thank you very much. JONES: Thank you, Colonel. EARHARDT: And thank you for serving our country. DOOCY: Yes, you know -- GAUB: Thank you. DOOCY: You bet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That's it for us. Have a wonderful weekend. BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: That was a good one, Katie, I like that one. All right. Thank you. PAVLICH: Thank you. BAIER: Good evening. I'm Bret Baier. President Trump tells workers at the Justice Department there will be accountability for the wrongs and abuses that have occurred, in his words. President also saying he's talking with Russia and Ukraine about a ceasefire. We will have the latest on the war and the possibility for peace. Space X prepares for a second time to launch a new crew to the space station and bring home two stranded astronauts. But breaking tonight, it appears a government shutdown has been averted. A short time ago, senators came up with enough votes to stop a Democratic filibuster against the House approved continuing resolution. This happened after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and almost a dozen fellow Democrats voted in favor of that. Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram tells us where things stand at this moment. Good evening, Chad. CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Bret, good evening. No government shutdown. The Senate voted to break a filibuster last hour, that put the GOP interim spending bill on a glide path to passage later tonight, probably with the help of Democrats. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and nine other Democrats voted to get the bill across the finish line. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): I believe that allowing Donald Trump to take even more power via a government shutdown is a far worse option. A shutdown would allow DOGE to shift into overdrive. PERGRAM (voice over): Some Democrats are raging at Schumer. House Democratic leaders torched the bill but ducked direct questions about Schumer. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is it time for new leadership in the Senate? REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): Next question. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So, do you -- have you lost confidence in him, the fact that you guys see this so differently? JEFFRIES: Next question. PERGRAM: Jeffries lashed out when pressed further about Schumer. Mr. Leader -- Mr. Leader, why were you afraid to say anything about Schumer when you were asked. JEFFRIES: No, no, no, no. Do not characterize my remarks. PERGRAM: No, my question was, why are you afraid to say anything? JEFFRIES: Do not characterize my remarks. I'm not afraid about anything, anything. PERGRAM: But you went to another question twice. JEFFRIES: Anything. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Isn't that -- isn't that a yes or no question? JEFFRIES: I said, I was very clear that we look forward to working with every single one of our Senate Democratic colleagues. PERGRAM (voice over): Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said failing to fight over the spending bill was, ""unacceptable."" Republicans relished the Democratic infighting. SEN. CYNTHIA LUMMIS (R-WY): For her to suggest that Chuck Schumer allow a government shutdown over his own budget. Man, she's losing her political mojo. (END VIDEOTAPE) PERGRAM (on camera): So, a shutdown is averted, but the fight underscored democratic divisions as Republicans show unity, a vote to pass the bill should come soon. It needs a simple majority, Bret. BAIER: Chad Pergram live on the Hill. Chad, thanks. President Trump, visited the Justice Department headquarters this afternoon, a place he has had issues with in the past. Today, he promised to bring accountability for prior wrongs and abuses there. Correspondent David Spunt is at the Justice Department tonight with the latest. Good evening, David. DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Bret, good evening to you. A significant moment in DOJ history, with a speech that lasted more than an hour, the president revealed that he was invited to come to DOJ. He said he said he thought about it for a little while, said maybe it might not be appropriate, but ultimately, said he should give this speech today in the same building where prosecutors, just a year ago tried to put him in jail. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TRUMP: We must be honest about the lies and abuses that have occurred within these walls. They weaponized the vast powers of our intelligence and law enforcement agencies to try and thwart the will of the American people. SPUNT (voice over): He walked into a room that erupted with applause. Absent were the majority of career DOJ attorneys replaced by members of law enforcement from across the country. On stage, a prop illustrating fentanyl in the devastating migration of the drug into the United States that Trump wants to stop. TRUMP: That's why I placed large tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China, and they will remain in place until these deadly poisons stop pouring into our country. SPUNT (voice over): Also in the room, A.G. Pam Bondi, Deputy A.G. Todd Blanche and FBI Director Kash Patel. But weaponization as Trump and Bondi see it, is a real threat. They promised to end it no matter the political persuasion. TRUMP: Our predecessors turned this Department of Justice into the department of injustice. But I stand before you today to declare that those days are over. SPUNT (voice over): The president's ire towards the DOJ developed in 2017 shortly after then A.G. Jeff Sessions recused himself in the Russia probe. Now, in his second act as president, Donald Trump made it clear the DOJ is his DOJ. TRUMP: As the chief law enforcement officer in our country, I will insist upon and demand full and complete accountability for the wrongs and abuses that have occurred. (END VIDEOTAPE) SPUNT (on camera): After the president finished outside, Representative Congressman Jamie Raskin called it a tirade. Said it was a brand new embarrassment to the once revered Department of Justice. Bret, the president did make some news. He announced that the FBI headquarters plan to be built in Maryland will stay right here in Washington, D.C. across from the DOJ, he said the two buildings should remain across from each other. He just wants to knock the current building down and build a new one, Bret. BAIER: David Spunt at the Justice Department. David, thank you. SPUNT: Thanks. BAIER: Breaking tonight, President Trump says he has had very good calls today with Russia and Ukraine as he tries to arrange a ceasefire between the warring nations. Senior White House Correspondent Jacqui Heinrich has the latest on the Ukraine situation live from the North Lawn. Good evening, Jacqui. JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. The president, just spoke to reporters as he takes off for Mar-a-Lago for the weekend. He said that he's getting from the standpoint of a ceasefire, pretty good vibes out of Russia, but he did not elaborate on what those vibes are. Putin has made no concessions, but a lot of demands, as far as we're aware, as he weighs this framework for a ceasefire proposed by the U.S. and agreed to by just Ukraine so far. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TRUMP: Just before I came here, I got some pretty good news, so, but we have to see what happens. It's still a long way to go. HEINRICH (voice over): Steve Witkoff will return from Moscow without a ceasefire, but the president and his team appear pleased at the progress. MARCO RUBIO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We'll examine the Russian position more closely and determine -- the president will then determine what the next steps are. Suffice it to say, I think there is reason to be cautiously optimistic. HEINRICH (voice over): Despite the unknowns. RUBIO: I think the question is, are we actually moving towards a ceasefire, or is this a delay tactic? I'm not going to answer that, because I can't characterize that for you right now. I think we'll know sooner rather than later. HEINRICH (voice over): President Trump calling on Putin to spare the lives of Ukrainian troops holding Russia's Kursk Region for the last seven months. TRUMP: You have a lot of Ukrainian soldiers that are encircled and in grave danger, and I've asked him not to kill those soldiers. HEINRICH (voice over): Putin's response: VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): I would like to emphasize that if they lay down their arms and surrender, they will be guaranteed life and decent treatment in accordance with the norms of international law and the laws of the Russian Federation. HEINRICH (voice over): Some experts say Putin won't agree to a ceasefire until Russia has that territory back. GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST: The 30- day ceasefire will favor the Ukrainians, because they will be able to rearm and reposition in the Kursk area. Russia is close to taking that and driving the Ukraine out of it, and I think he's going to delay this until that is accomplished. HEINRICH (voice over): Zelenskyy says Putin is delaying because exiting the war would leave him with nothing. And, ""That is why he is now doing everything he can to sabotage diplomacy by setting extremely difficult and unacceptable conditions right from the start, even before a ceasefire. Pressure must be applied to the one who does not want to stop the war."" (END VIDEOTAPE) HEINRICH (on camera): Now we're hearing Putin reportedly made Steve Witkoff wait some eight hours for their meeting. Witkoff is not back in the U.S. yet, and has not given a personal readout publicly yet. Back in the U.S. however, NATO Secretary General this morning downplayed concerns that President Trump would withdraw the U.S. from the Alliance, saying that everyone understands that Europe has to pay more for its defense, Bret. BAIER: Jacqui Heinrich live in the North Lawn. Jacqui, thank you. Anti-Israel students and activists protesting again today at Columbia University. The Trump administration responding by turning up the heat on the school and what he calls anti-Semitic demonstrators. Senior Correspondent Eric Shawn is at Columbia again tonight. Good evening, Eric. ERIC SHAWN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. The pro- Palestinian protesters who are so ubiquitous here and Columbia University itself are now being investigated for possibly violating federal terrorism laws. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SHAWN (voice over): Their chants have been heard for months, and now the Trump administration is really putting up the pressure. Last night, agents from the Homeland Security Department searched two dormitory rooms of two Columbia students, a move the university president said left her, ""heart broken."" In Washington, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche also said Columbia is being investigated for possibly hiding illegal aliens on campus. TODD BLANCHE, DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL: That investigation is ongoing, and we are also looking at whether Columbia's handling of earlier incidents violated civil rights laws and included terrorism crimes. This is long overdue. SHAWN (voice over): The two students whose rooms were searched were not named, but U.S. officials say they revoked the visas of two Columbia students who supported Hamas. One, a doctoral student from India who authorities say advocated violence and terrorism here, the other identified as a Palestinian woman who had been arrested at Columbia's protest last April while she was arrested again in Newark for allegedly overstaying her visa, but Columbia says there is no record of her being a student. Secretary of State Marco Rubio says in the wake of these protests, all student visas are now being reviewed. RUBIO: In the days to come, you should expect more visas will be revoked as we identify people that we should never have allowed in because they lied to us when they said they were coming here to be students. They didn't say they were coming here to occupy university buildings and vandalize them and tear them apart and hold -- have campuses hostage. (END VIDEOTAPE) SHAWN (on camera): Meanwhile, the lawyers for Mahmoud Khalil, who was one of the leaders of the protests here at Columbia, they are suing the Trump administration, claiming that the White House is violating his civil and First Amendment rights. Khalil is still being held in a Louisiana federal detention center for immigrants and immigration. He has a hearing on his case on deportation in two weeks, Bret. BAIER: Eric Shawn live outside Columbia. Eric, thanks. More than 50 universities are being investigated for alleged racial discrimination as part of President Trump's campaign to end Diversity Equity and Inclusion programs, DEI. The Education Department announcing a new series of investigations today, one month after issuing a memo warning America's schools and colleges that they could lose federal money over race based preferences in admissions, scholarships or any aspect of student life. Stocks rallied today to their best day since last November's election as investors buy the dip, the Dow surged 675, the S&P 500 was up 117, the NASDAQ gained 451, today. For the week, the Dow lost three percentage points. The S&P 500 fell 2-1/4. The NASDAQ was down 2.5. Up next, the latest on the search for a missing American college student in the Dominican Republic. And later, we speak with the Irish Prime Minister about trade relations with the U.S. and his meeting with President Trump, of course, ahead of St. Patrick's Day. First, here's what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. Fox 31 in Denver, with the investigation into a fire on an American Airlines plane, the Boeing 737-800 was diverted from Dallas to Denver International Airport. 12 people were taken to hospitals with minor injuries. And this is a live look at Tenakee Springs, Alaska, courtesy of Earth Cam. Beautiful day there. One of the big stories there tonight, former reality T.V. star Jessie Holmes wins the longest ever Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. Holmes crossed the finish line in Nome more than 1100 miles. The route was changed from its normal 1000 miles because of lack of snow. That's tonight's live look outside the Beltway from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Fox Weather Alert now, a sweeping storm system threatening to bring blizzards and possibly wildfires to different regions of the country. The National Weather Service saying an outbreak of severe storms ramping up tonight could spawn tornadoes, heavy snow and high winds in the Great Plains could make travel treacherous in the Dakotas and parts of Minnesota. Forecasters say strong winds and warm, dry weather farther south pose a critical risk of wildfires in Northwest Texas, Oklahoma and a portion of southeast Kansas. Tornado threats again will push into the south tomorrow. Tonight we're hearing from a man who authorities say was the last person to see an American college student who disappeared last week as the search continues in the Dominican Republic. Correspondent Nate Foy has the latest on the investigation from Punta Cana. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Every day the military is over here, so we see them in the morning. NATE FOY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): On day eight of the search for missing college student Sudiksha Konanki. The man last seen with her, is now identified as Joshua Riibe from Iowa. He told Dominican authorities they met that night and went to the beach after drinking at the hotel bar, saying, ""We were waist deep in the water, talking and we kissed a little."" Riibe told authorities, a big wave pushed them out to sea, and he tried rescuing Konanki by towing her back to shore, adding, ""I was trying to keep her breathing the whole time, which didn't allow me to breathe properly, and I swallowed a lot of water."" Riibe says he left Konanki in knee deep water, telling authorities, ""The last time I saw her, I asked if she was OK. I didn't hear her response, because I started vomiting all the sea water I had swallowed. After vomiting, I looked around and didn't see anyone. I thought she had grabbed her things and left."" Riibe refused to answer eight questions on the advice of his lawyers, including how he felt about Konanki's disappearance, if she could swim and if he ever reported their experience to the hotel or authorities. Riibe's parents tell Fox News, ""Despite his full willingness to cooperate, Josh has been detained under irregular conditions and subjected to extensive questioning without the presence of official translators or legal counsel."" A former FBI agent tells Fox News, digital American assistance will be crucial to solving this case. SCOTT DUFFEY, FORMER FBI AGENT: They don't have the necessary police resources. They don't have the necessary training. They're not trained like our American law enforcement. (END VIDEOTAPE) FOY (on camera): The Loudoun County Sheriff's Office, where Konanki is from, confirms with Fox News tonight, the two of their detectives interviewed Riibe here in Punta Cana yesterday, those detectives are now headed back to the United States as the FBI continues supporting this investigation, Bret. BAIER: Nate Foy on the ground in Dominican Republic. Nate, thanks. Up next, new details about the what the U.S. did and did not know ahead of that Israeli pager attack on Hamas terrorists, we'll bring you that. First, Beyond our Borders tonight. Pakistan's military accuses neighboring India of sponsoring insurgents in a southwestern province where an attack by armed separatists killed at least 26 passengers aboard a hijacked train. Military provided no evidence of its claim. India promptly denied that accusation. And this is a live look at Toronto courtesy of Earth Cam, one of the big stories there tonight, top of diplomats from the Group of Seven industrial democracies, the G7 agree on a joint statement expressing support for Ukraine and a U.S. ceasefire proposal. The conference came as President Trump's trade policies and taunts towards host Canada overshadowed those talks. Just some of the other stories Beyond our Borders tonight, we'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Palestinian terror group Hamas says it has accepted a proposal from mediators to release one living AmericanIsraeli hostage and the bodies of four dual nationals who had died in captivity. The Israeli prime minister's office is casting doubt on this offer, accusing Hamas of trying to manipulate talks underway in Qatar on the next stage of the Israel Hamas ceasefire. Also tonight, we're learning new details of U.S. knowledge about Israel's stunning attacks on terrorists in September of last year, using devices detonated by remote control. Chief National Security Correspondent Jennifer Griffin has the story from the Pentagon. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The call to the Pentagon came 30 minutes before thousands of pagers packed with explosives blew up in the hands of Hezbollah operatives. Now, for the first time, a top Pentagon official from the Biden administration explains that Israel's defense minister did not tell Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin the details of the Israeli operation in advance. DANIEL SHAPIRO, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT DEFENSE SECRETARY: He said, we have a special capability which we are about to exercise in Lebanon targeting Hezbollah, and you'll soon see evidence of that. GRIFFIN (voice over): Former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said in a recent podcast, the entire course of the war after October 7th could have been changed if Netanyahu had agreed to launch the exploding walkie talkie operation against Hezbollah's leadership on October 11th, 2023. Four days after the Hamas attack from Gaza. YOAV GALLANT, ISRAELI MINISTER OF DEFENSE: 15,000 terrorists would have put their vest with the walkie talkie on their chest. In this walkie talkie, there was three times more explosives that we had in the beepers later on. The major operation, the one that we invested in for so many years, it was ready for use. GRIFFIN (voice over): Netanyahu has pushed back, saying not enough exploding pagers were ready at that point, the Israelis ended up waiting almost a year. GALLANT: This is something we could have done on October 11th and eliminate Hezbollah. GRIFFIN (voice over): It's not the first time the Israelis decided to go it alone without U.S. approval. In 2007, the Bush administration would not agree to carry out a joint strike on Syria's nuclear reactor. President Bush worried it could spark a larger Middle East war, the same concern Defense Secretary Austin had when Gallant had told him of plans to assassinate the leader of Hamas in Tehran and Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut. (END VIDEOTAPE) GRIFFIN (on camera): And maybe one reason the former Israeli Defense Minister gave scant details to his Pentagon counterpart before the pagers exploded, Bret. BAIER: Jennifer Griffin at the Pentagon. Jennifer, thank you. In just a few minutes, SpaceX will try again to launch a rocket carrying a new crew to the International Space Station. Wednesday's return trip is supposed to include two NASA astronauts who have been at that station since last summer. Correspondent Jonathan Serrie is at Kennedy Space Center tonight. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Clearing the way for a second launch attempt, ground teams flushed trapped air from hydraulic system in the clamp arm that supports the SpaceX rocket on the launch pad, resolving an issue that led to Wednesday's scrubbed launch. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: SpaceX countdown one at this time, we are standing down from today to further address hydraulic release data. SERRIE: NASA and SpaceX are trying to send two Americans, a Russian, and a Japanese astronaut to the ISS to rotate out four current crew members, including NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams who have been working on the space station since June when their Boeing Starliner spacecraft developed intermittent thruster problems on its first piloted flight test. BUTCH WILMORE, NASA ASTRONAUT: We came up prepared to stay long even though we planned to stay short. SERRIE: This will be the first crew rotation on ISS since SpaceX CEO Elon Musk posted on social media, ""It's time to prepare preparations for deorbiting the space station. It has served its purpose. There is very little incremental utility. Let's go to Mars."" The ISS is scheduled to be retired in 2030 when it can be replaced with commercial options. Until then, crew members say it's important to leverage the orbiting lab. SUNI WILLIAMS, NASA ASTRONAUT: We should make the most of this space station for our taxpayers, all of our international partners, and hold our obligations and do that world class science that this laboratory is capable of. SERRIE: Tonight's instantaneous launch window requires liftoff at exactly 7:03 eastern to reach the proper trajectory docking with the ISS at 11:30 Saturday night. Butch and Suni would return to earth on Wednesday at the earliest. (END VIDEO TAPE) SERRIE (on camera): It all depends on weather conditions at splashdown sites next week. Now, as for the trip up, NASA says weather conditions are 95 percent favorable for a launch tonight. Bret? BAIER: Jonathan Serrie at the Kennedy Space Center. Jonathan, thanks. Up next, my interview with Irish Prime Minister Michael Martin on his meeting with President Trump. And later, the panel on the Ukraine ceasefire proposal, the showdown in the Senate, and the narrowly avoided government shutdown. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: The E.U. was set up in order to take advantage of the United States. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Including Ireland? Is Ireland taking advantage of the U.S. TRUMP: Of course they are. There is a massive deficit that we have with Ireland, and with other countries, too. And we want to sort of even that out as nicely as we can. MICHAEL MARTIN, IRISH PRIME MINISTER: It's a two way street, too. And we are investing a lot more in America. I think it's a relationship that we can develop and that will endure into the future. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: The meeting there in the Oval Office. Joining us tonight is the Irish Prime Minister Michael Martin. Mr. Prime Minister, thanks for the time. MARTIN: You are more than welcome, Bret. It's a pleasure. BAIER: What's your takeaway from that Oval Office meeting and your time with President Trump? MARTIN: First of all, I think one takeaway was President Trump was a very gracious host, and it was a positive and warm meeting. He was a lot of affection for Ireland. That was very clear in our discussions. And he asked a lot of questions about the peace process in Northern Ireland, for example, and reconciliation on the island of Ireland. But, of course, yes, he did raise trade issues, and he admired many of our economic moves and decisions that Ireland took in relation to taxation but also in terms of development of the country and the modernization of the country, and specifically referenced the pharmaceutical agency. And of course, one of the agenda for me this week and in my discussions with President Trump is that the economic relationship between Ireland and the United States is a very robust one, expanding. And it's a two way street. So you have up to 700 Irish companies now providing well over 150,000 to 200,000 jobs in the United States. And we are in the top 10 foreign investment into the United States. So it's a two-way street. And I think we are anxious to make that point, also, and many of those companies have added value by our presence in Ireland and their access to the European market and Asian markets. BAIER: You have attracted companies, there is no doubt about it, because of the sales tax there and other reasons. But the president is pointing to a $50-plus billion dollars deficit when it comes to U.S. trade with Ireland. You point, obviously, to the investment that Ireland makes in the U.S. and the billions of dollars that come this way. How do you think it's going to fall out when this reciprocal tariff goes into effect April 2nd, not only for you and products in Ireland but around the world when it comes to the U.S.? What's your take on that? MARTIN: Of course, I could add if you take services into account, Ireland would be in deficit trade-wise, but I know that the focus has been on goods. And some of the issues that don't carried in statistics which are worth recalling, Ryan Air, the biggest Irish airline along with Air Cap, for example, collectively buy more Boeing aircraft in the world than anyone else in the world outside of America. That doesn't get captured in those statistics, up to $120 billion over -- on the books. But in terms of the issue, I want to resolve through dialogue. There are issues, and we appreciate that. And I welcome today the statement from Commissioner Sefcovic that he had an important engagement with Secretary of State for commerce Howard Lutnick, and that's positive. Ultimately, I think tariff and trade wars will damage all of us and damage economies and consumers. BAIER: How do you expect, though, to work well with the Trump administration given the fact that this administration really does support Israel very strongly. You have been very outspoken about the Israel-Hamas and the situation in Gaza. And Ireland is a leader in the International Criminal Court case against Israel, a major U.S. ally. So how do you square that? MARTIN: Well, first of all, the fundamental point is that we would agree with President Trump's call for and decision to ensure that there would be a ceasefire. We have been calling for a ceasefire from early on because we don't want innocent civilians killed. We have condemned Hamas, by the way, repeatedly. We have sanctions on Hamas. And I went to Israel in solidarity with Israel after October the 7th. I went to Kibbutz Beri. I saw for myself the horrific impact that that barbaric attack had. Kibbutz Be'eri. And we have always been on the side of a peaceful solution involving a two-state solution. We welcome President Trump's unrelenting focus on peace in the Middle East and in Ukraine. And his envoy did make things happen early on in his administration to bring about that cessation. Our focus now is on copper fastening the ceasefire, getting all of the hostages out. In our view, we have said from the very start that they should have been released unconditionally. And also, a surge of humanitarian aid into Gaza, because it is hell on earth for families and people living there. Hamas has done terrible damage to its own community. And we have always been consistently on the side of peace and people living in harmony alongside of each other, which is the ultimate guarantor of security. It's a very complex situation, that I acknowledge. But I think our agreement with President Trump is on the centrality of peace and the need to try to copper fasten the ceasefire that has occurred and get all of the hostages out as quickly as we can now. BAIER: Mr. Prime Minister, finally, Monday is a big day in America. Irish Americans celebrate it. There are more -- there are tens and tens of thousands of Irish Americans who will Monday celebrate Saint Patrick's Day. What's your message to the faithful here in the U.S.? MARTIN: My message is to thank you for your outstanding ambassadors for Ireland in the United States. And President Trump referenced the number of Congressional Medals of Honor won by the Irish, I think 58 percent won by the Irish down through the decades and the centuries, and the role of Ireland in American independence. But IrishAmerica have been great ambassadors for Ireland. They built this nation, with others, of course. They've built a great nation in the United States. It's a wonderful, wonderful day where the historic ties and the bonds of friendship, cultural, economic, social, and family are celebrated. And the contribution of IrishAmerica to the United States is also marked and is also celebrated. I say to IrishAmerica, thank you for your service to the United States, but also for being outstanding ambassadors for the values and the spirit of Ireland. BAIER: Mr. Prime Minister, we will raise a pint for you Monday at the Dubliner down the road, and thank you very much for your time. MARTIN: Please do. (LAUGHTER) BAIER: Up next, the panel on the Ukraine cease fire proposal and the narrowly avoided government shutdown. As we go break, though, former Senator Alan Simpson has died. After struggling to recover from a broken hip suffered in December, the Wyoming Republican served three terms in the Senate. And he was known for his quick wit and bipartisan attitude. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALAN SIMPSON, (R-WY) FORMER U.S. SENATOR: Humor is a universal solvent against the abrasive elements of life. All people with a ""D"" behind their name did not become a guard at Lenin's tomb, and all people with an ""R"" behind their name did not crawl out of a cave in the mountains. That's a sparrow belch in the midst of this typhoon. (END VIDEO CLIP) (LAUGHTER) BAIER: Alan Simpson was 93. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: I think we are doing well, as you have been hearing about Ukraine. I think we are doing now well with Russia. We are speaking with President Putin. We want to get the war over. MARCO RUBIO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: The only way to end this war is through a process of negotiations. Negotiations, be it in business, in commerce, or in geopolitics, involves both sides giving something. RAHM EMANUEL, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL AND GLOBAL AFFAIRS COMMENTATOR: If you think for a moment President Putin is going to look at this moment, and it looks like he gets everything he wanted, that he is obviously going to rest? Not a chance. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: A lot of back and forth on the Russia-Ukraine ceasefire possibility as the president taking to Truth Social today saying he had a productive call with Vladimir Putin, ""very good and productive discussions with President Putin of Russia yesterday. And there's a very good chance that this horrible, bloody war can finally come to an end. But at this very moment, thousands of Ukrainian troops are completely surrounded by the Russian military and in a very bad and vulnerable position. I have strongly requested to President Putin that their lives be spared. This would be a horrible massacre, one not seen since World War II. God bless them all."" With that, let's start with the panel. Let's bring in ""THE FIVE"" co-host Jessica Tarlov, syndicated radio host Hugh Hewitt, and Olivia Beavers, congressional reporter for ""Politico"". Hugh, your thoughts on where this stands and what is being talked about here on progress? HUGH HEWITT, SYNDICATED RADIO HOST: I think we're doing pretty well from the perspective of President Trump and Secretary Rubio. Vladimir Putin is a war cri",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 Donald Trump has increased pressure on him by winding down the export license in a way that the Biden regency never did. But he is talking softly, or he's posting softly and carrying a big stick. This afternoon at the G-7 in Canada, Marco Rubio and the other G-7 ministers threatened to up the sanctions if Putin does not accept the peace proposal that's being put forward. So I watched over the course of two months both in the Oval Office and on your show, Bret, because they have all gone from the Oval over to your show, all these leaders coming on to say, hey, Putin, listen up. And they are using that soft touch, but there is a very hard stick behind it. And I think that Trump is pulling this off. BAIER: Is there optimism, Olivia, on Capitol Hill, do you think? And has the dynamic changed up there when it comes to Ukraine? OLIVIA BEAVERS," """"POLITICO"""": The dynamic has certainly changed. There is a few outspoken pro-Ukrainian Republicans", and right now they are holding out hope that I think President Trump would be taking more of a embrace with Zelenskyy and Ukraine and using his powers in these negotiations. And I don't think that they're really feeling that much hope right now. But Republicans generally are supportive of him inserting himself in these negotiations and pushing the war to end. They definitely lost support, and you saw Trump and Republicans hammering that point on the campaign trail. And so it just is where the party is right now. They don't really care to be sending more additional funding at the moment. BAIER: Yes. Meantime, President Trump went to the Department of Justice today, delivered a speech, prettied pointed at times. Jessica, take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: We must be honest about the lies and abuses that have occurred within these walls. Unfortunately, in recent years, a corrupt group of hacks and radicals within the ranks of the American government obliterated the trust and goodwill built up over generations. They weaponized the vast powers of our intelligence and law enforcement agencies to try and thwart the will of the American people. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Jessica, his folks, his supporters say he has every right to do that after all that came out of that building. Obviously, detractors say differently. JESSICA TARLOV, CO-HOST," """"THE FIVE"""": Yes. I guess put me in the detractor column", which probably will come as no surprise. BAIER: Shockingly. TARLOV: I just want to keep things wild here on a Friday night, Bret. But he did go on to talk about his opponents, the people -- the judges, those who have taken him to court, as scum and said that they deserve to be jailed. So, if he is trying to strike a new tone or say that we should move away from a, quote-unquote, weaponization of the DOJ, obviously that's not what he has in mind. And he has the perfect team in order to be able to all in off. They have ultimate loyalty and fealty to Donald Trump. And I think it's a very scary time for people who fall into any of those categories. Whether it's people who have been involved with him in the courtroom or people even in the media. He was speaking later on saying, what does he call it, MSDNC and CNN, those liars, and that what they do is illegal, which is taking it a step further than I don't like the very nasty press. BAIER: Hugh, your thoughts about this in the wake of everything we have seen out of Justice, the FBI, et cetera, over the years? HEWITT: Thank you for coming to me, Bret. Put me in the column of DOJ alum that served as a special assistant to two attorneys general running the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants program. Those of house served in the Reagan DOJ have been disgusted for the past four years by the non-leadership of Eric Garland, by the politicization of Jack Smith, by the attacks on the president, by the lawfare that was a previous low that was never experienced during the Reagan years or the Bush years. It is appalling to anyone who is objective about what has hand at DOJ. And Pam Bondi is doing a great job in setting it straight along withed to Todd Blanch. I'm sure Kash Patel is doing the same thing at the FBI. There is no DOJ where you are partisan. There is only a DOJ where the rule of law to apply. It was abandoned for four years in an attempt to get Donald Trump, and they're setting the ship right. BAIER: Olivia, meantime, lawmakers narrowly avoid a government shut down. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, (D-NY) SENATE MINORITY LEADER: As bad as these CR is, I believe that allowing Donald Trump to take even more power via a government shutdown is a far worse option. REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, (D-NY): Just to see Senate Democrats even consider acquiescing to Elon Musk, I think it is a huge slap in the face. SEN. JOHN BARRASSO," (R-WY): The Democrats are willing to hurt the American people because they are so mad they want to punish the Americans for voting for Donald Trump and Republicans in November. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Democrats put us into this situation (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: """"New York Times"""""," """"Young Democrats anger boils over as Schumer retreats on shutdown. They are chafing at and increasingly complaining about what they see as feebleness of the old guard's efforts to push back against President Trump."""" You just heard """"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York who burst onto the political scene by slaying a giant of the party in the 2018 primary challenge pointedly declined to shoot down a question about a future primary against Mr. Schumer."""" So", there is some angst about this deal, Olivia. BEAVERS: There is. And I mean, I don't think I can remember a time in recent memory when Republicans -- House Republicans were able to narrowly pass this bill and then totally squeeze Democrats. Schumer had to walk back remarks about dismissing a bill and a 30-day plan and actually embrace this because then they were eating their words about how a shutdown is bad for the government. And that put him in a position of taking fire from AOC and these other progressives, especially those in the House, who feel like they should have been fighting it. They should have fought and got into a shutdown. So really Democrats did not have a winning hand in this, and Republicans really had a win. BAIER: Quickly, Jessica, they were back in a corner either way. TARLOV: Yes, definitely. But it feels like this is a moment where the Democratic Party and certainly the base wants to see some fight, even if you are going to end up losing in the end. And the House went out there and did it. Hakeem Jeffries with the exception of Jared Golden who voted for it, got everyone in line. They went against it. And there are all of these vulnerable Democratic senators, moderates in swing states, people up for reelection who stuck their necks out and then feel like Schumer didn't really meet the moment. My text message is full of do you want AOC or Pat Ryan to be the one to primary Chuck Schumer? (LAUGHTER) BAIER: You never know. We'll see. TARLOV: I go Pat Ryan. BAIER: Panel, thanks so much. Make it a great weekend. There you go. Well, you know that sound. That means it's Friday," and it is time for """"Notable Quotables."""" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't know if Chuck Schumer had on his bingo card that he would be the most hated man in Washington. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER", (D-NY) SENATE MINORITY LEADER: The potential for a shutdown has consequences for America that are much, much worse. We're going to wait to see what the house does first. SEN. SUSAN COLLINS, (D-ME): The worst of all worlds is the government shut down. It just represents the ultimate failure to govern effectively. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're going to arrest your tail. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They're getting dragged out of Trump Tower by their arms and their legs. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: President Trump says is he going to buy a tesla. Did he buy it? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, full market price. BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: The stock market has predicted ten of the last three recessions. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Today people will die in this war. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Does Putin want peace? If he does, he has a funny way of showing it. DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: Do you know you have Rosie O'Donnell? You are better off not knowing. (LAUGHTER) What's with these socks? I am trying to stay focused. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's like an arranged marriage. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Canadians and Americans, we're in a little bit of a tiff, a little poo-poo right now. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He is protecting American industries. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Have you ever paid a tariff? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think it's insulting that you are trying to test my knowledge. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm here on FOX. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Has to be some head gel, baby. (END VIDEO CLIP) (LAUGHTER) BAIER: One week. One week. Monday on SPECIAL REPORT, we will talk with Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner who will take us on an eye-opening tour of his agency, HUD. We'll take you there. Please join Jacqui Heinrich for FOX NEWS SUNDAY this weekend.

Emily Compagno, Tyrus, our studio audience. ""FOX NEWS @ NIGHT"". I'm Greg Gutfeld. I love you, America. TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANCHOR: Good evening. I'm Trace Gallagher. It's 11:00 p.m. on the East Coast, 8:00 here in Los Angeles, and this is America's late news, FOX NEWS @ NIGHT. And breaking tonight, the cease fire between Israel and Hamas that lasted almost two months is over. Israeli Defense Forces launching strikes in Gaza at this very moment. Israel says it is done, waiting for the release of hostages still being held by the terror group. In moments, we'll take you live to Trey Yingst, he is on the ground for us with the very latest in Israel. Meantime, back here at home, it is the executive branch versus the judicial branch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEPHEN MILLER, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF: A district court judge has no authority to direct the national security operations of the executive branch. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: President Trump locked in a new battle with the courts. This time, it's over the administration's deportation of more than 200 Venezuelan gang members, with President Trump, saying, you can't stay here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: Meantime, Democrats, battling each other as a new poll from a liberal news outlet shows terrible news for Democrats. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA REPORTER: Democrats, call your office. You know where March Madness times, terrible, terrible, terrible. CNN/SRS. Look at this, 29 percent. NBC News, you want to go lower than that? How about 27 percent? Both are record lows. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: We'll have more numbers for you in a bit, but we begin with the breaking news out of the Middle East, where the Israel Hamas cease fire appears to be over. The chief foreign correspondent Trey Yingst is live for us in Tel Aviv with the very latest on this. Trey. TREY YINGST, FOX NEWS CHANNEL FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Trace. Good evening. Israeli fighter jets are currently striking the Gaza Strip, as the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has collapsed. There are major questions now about what comes next. We are told by Israeli officials that all options remain on the table, and this includes the possibility of a ground component. Now tonight, Palestinian media inside Gaza is reporting more than 100 people killed in the strikes, with hundreds more injured. Fox News cannot independently confirm those numbers. Other reports also indicating that high ranking Hamas officials were targeted in some of the air strikes that took place earlier this evening. As we look forward here, we do expect the prime minister's office to release more information tomorrow morning. But tonight, there was a brief statement released by the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying, from now on, Israel will operate against Hamas with increasing military force. We also understand that Israel's Home Front Command, responsible for delivering emergency messages to the civilian population, has closed all schools in the Gaza envelope for tomorrow. Trace? GALLAGHER: Trey, I just want to know because nobody knows this region better than you and these two -- these two forces that are fighting. Any chance that this cease fire goes back into play in the next few days? YINGST: It's a great question. Look, there is a possibility that this all subsides and negotiating teams are able to go back to the table in Cairo or Doha, and try to hammer out an agreement after this new pressure was put on Hamas. But it's going to be incredibly difficult, because when you think about the death toll inside Gaza and also the factor of the hostages, it complicates an already difficult and challenging situation on the ground. You have both sides saying the other is firing. You have the Israelis saying that Hamas is preparing for future attacks. Hamas is looking at the situation right now, saying the Israelis are striking the Gaza Strip. And then, amid all of this, you have the civilians and the hostages in between. Trace. GALLAGHER: Yes. And there are the hostages. Trey Yingst, live for us on the ground in Tel Aviv. We'll get back to you as the news warrants. Trey, thank you. Meantime, the showdown over the Trump administration's deportation of hundreds of Venezuelans was front and center at a very tense hearing in a federal courtroom late today. Bill Melugin is live with the latest on that. Bill, good evening. BILL MELUGIN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Trace, good evening to you. The Trump administration is saying that the judge who tried to stop them from deporting Venezuelan gang members via the alien enemies act vastly overstepped his authority. Now they're asking a circuit court to remove him from the case entirely. In a filing today, the Trump DOJ writes, in part, quote, this Court should also immediately reassign this case to another district court judge, given the highly unusual and improper procedures. For example, certification of a class action involving members of a designated foreign terrorist organization in less than 18 hours with no discovery and no briefing from the government. Now, the Trump administration says they deported more than 200 Tren de Aragua gang members to El Salvador on Saturday, 137 of which were via the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: These were bad people. That was a bad group of, as I say, hombres. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: These rogue judges have to stop. This is an executive decision. TOM HOMAN, UNITED STATES BORDER CZAR: We're not stopping. I don't care what the judges think. I don't care the left thinks. We are coming (END VIDEO CLIP) MELUGIN: And Trace, DHS also confirms that a doctor who is in the U.S. on a visa and working at Brown University was deported to Lebanon over the weekend. This is after she flew into Boston's Logan Airport and CBP found photos of her attending dead Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah funeral in Beirut. Her attorneys have since withdrawn from representing her. Her visa now revoked. GALLAGHER: We're going to talk about her is coming up in a little bit. Bill, thank you. Let's bring in Madison Ventures+ principal and chief strategy officer, Mitch Roschelle, along with Fox News political analyst Gianno Caldwell, thank you both for coming on. I want to play some sound to you first, Gianno. This is Peter Doocy with Karoline Leavitt, talking about Tren de Aragua. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: If you guys can't send 200 Tren de Aragua terrorists at a time to El Salvador, where are you going to send them instead? KAROLINE LEAVITT, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: It's a very good question. You'd have to ask the courts and the people on the left, who are trying to fight this administration for doing the business that this president sought out to do. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: I mean, it's amazing, Gianno, I've never seen where the government is literally trying to, you know, push criminals into this, back into the U.S. system. GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes, the courts are attempting to do that. And we know there is a separation of powers. The constitution is very clear on that than to have judges trying to create policy for the entire nation when the American people has -- have been very clear as to what they want when it comes to these criminals and these immigrant gangs that have come to the United States, is just beyond belief. I got to tell you, we know that there's about 8 million people have come over here that they say. We don't know what the exact number is. Some people put it at 11 to 17 million. But either way, the American people spoke loudly and clearly in the election of this past November that they want these immigration levels reduced, and they certainly want the criminals out. So, this is insane. GALLAGHER: Yes, and we're going to put the numbers up on the board and show exactly what they want and what they are getting. Mitch, to you now, Tom Homan was asked a pretty -- I think it was a pretty slamdunkable (PH) question. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What do you say to those who claim you're using a 200- year-old law to circumvent due process? HOMAN: An old law? Not as old as constitution, we still pay attention that. Don't we? (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: And new laws work like old laws. MITCH ROSCHELLE, CHIEF STRATEGY OFFICER, MADISON VENTURES+: Listen, you got to pick the ones that fit. However, here is an issue that Americans just can't tolerate. Think about the people in Aurora, Colorado. Their streets were not safe. (CROSSTALK) GALLAGHER: Right. ROSCHELLE: So, this president did what Americans want him to do, which is round up the bad guys and ship them back from where they came. It's pretty simple. So, the judge intervened, absolutely ridiculous. But the point is, whatever the law is, isn't the question. The American people voted for safety -- a protected border, and that's what they should get. GALLAGHER: And you talk about just that, Gianno. We talked about numbers. Here is the CNN data guy, talking about how bad the numbers are for the Democratic Party. Just play this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ENTEN: View Democratic Party favorably. CNN/SRS, look at this 29 percent. NBC News, you want to go lower than that? How about 27 percent? Both are record lows. All I can say is, I'm a big fan of the oldies, so I'm going to quote Chubby Checker. How low can you go? (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: He could have all done the twist as well, Gianno. But the bottom line, is Democrats are changing. What do you think about the numbers? CALDWELL: Well, it's been very clear to many of us, especially since the Biden years, the Democratic brand has been dog food. To many Americans. You think about the price of goods and how President Trump has been able to reverse course when it comes to the CPI, the Consumer Price Index, and we see in the lower pricing with eggs, gas, et cetera. But that did not happen for four years. The American people suffered. And Democrats, they doubled down, trans issue, and many other things that were very unpopular with the American people. So, it's not surprising to see those numbers, because the democratic brand has been dog food. GALLAGHER: Yes, I want to put this up on the screen, because Democrats right now, there is in fighting. Right? But when you -- when you ask, what you want Democrats to do? Do you want Democrats in Congress? To look at 32 percent make compromises. 65 percent Mitch, say, stick to your guns. Do not give the Republicans an inch. ROSCHELLE: That is the most idiotic policy ever. Do the opposite of what the Republicans want, regardless of whether or not that's the best thing for America. I don't -- I don't understand that. But the Democrats is suffering from two things. A lack of leadership and policies that are just plainly unpopular. GALLAGHER: Yes. ROSCHELLE: And when you have unpopular policies and you have a rudderless ship, these are the kind of numbers you get. GALLAGHER: Boy, the numbers are bad and they might get worse. Mitch, Gianno, thank you, both. ROSCHELLE: OK. GALLAGHER: Meantime, the legacy media is now giving the Democrats a boost by weighing in on the showdown over deportation orders. Ashley Strohmier is live for us in New York City with that side of the story. Ashley, good evening. ASHLEY STROHMIER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANCHOR: Hi, Trace. The mainstream media is not taking too kindly to President Trump's decision to deport alleged members of the Venezuelan gang, Tren de Aragua, claiming he defied court orders on purpose. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ARI MELBER, HOST, MSNBC: There are valid questions here about whether this is now, and I'm going to say it plainly, an intentional autocratic effort by the Trump administration to break the law, and then violate judicial orders that enforce the law they are accused of, and in some cases, according to judicial findings, having been found to have broken. STROHMIER (voice over): They also say not enough is known about the people being forced out of the country without due process. DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: They over and over, said, we're going to start with the most criminal among us, but we don't have any evidence of who the people really are and what their backgrounds truly are. (END VIDEO CLIP) STROHMIER: OK. So, despite all of this, a new NBC poll -- news poll shows a majority of voters approve of how the Trump administration is handling border security and immigration. 56 percent say he's bringing about the right kind of change on the issue. And that same poll, Trace, shows Trump with the highest approval rating he has ever had as president. Back to you. GALLAGHER: Big numbers. Ashley Strohmier, live for us in New York. Ashley, thank you. Well, on that note, the FOX NEWS @ NIGHT ""COMMON SENSE DEPARTMENT"", is not one bit surprised that the Democratic Party's popularity is at an all-time low. And ""COMMON SENSE"" would assume that Democrats are not one bit surprised their party's popularity is at an all-time low, because the Democrats keep doubling down on all-time lows. And while the Democrats numbers plummet, the highest number of Americans since 2004 think the country is headed in the right direction. So, why are Democrats headed in the wrong direction, seemingly on purpose? The same people who refuse to applaud for a cancer stricken 13-year-old boy are now outraged that violent Venezuelan gang members are being deported. How can you cheer for Luigi Mangione and Mahmoud Khalil and not cry for the families of Laken Riley and Jocelyn Nungaray? Why is Whoopi Goldberg, telling us that if Trump can deport terrorists, he can deport, ""any of us?"" The only thing the left would be more upset about as if a terrorist was transgender and was banned from female sports. It's kind of obvious why Americans don't like the Democratic Party, because the Democratic Party is unlikable. In fact, polls show the most popular Democrat right now is Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, followed by Kamala Harris. ""COMMON SENSE"" thinks, when your favorite Democrat is AOC, your party is not a OK. Let's bring in New York Post reporter Lydia Moynihan, and the host of ""A Home That Heals"" podcast, one of America's great former T.V. news anchors, Dee Sarton. It's great to have you both on. Dee, I want to play some sound. This is the NBC guy, talking about the right direction, wrong direction numbers. He said the following. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEVE KORNACKI, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, MSNBC: First of all, the mood of the country. This really jumped out. We asked folks, is it down the right direction or the wrong direction? That 44 percent who say right direction, that's up since November. And if that doesn't seem like a lot, the last time it cracked 40 percent, you got to go back to 2012. The last time it actually hit 44 or higher, January of 2004. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: They voted for it, Dee, and they think it's working. DEE SARTON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANCHOR: Well, I think they're -- they've got the proof right in front of them there. And it's sure interesting to watch this play out, because, you know, those numbers reflect something so real within American people. And that is that they can spell -- smell spin, and they can detect authenticity. And I think that because the clear communication coming out of the Trump administration from the top to the bottom, all the way through those ""COMMON SENSE"", you -- that's your favorite phrase, I think. Those clear answers that reflect the ""COMMON SENSE"" that Americans share. That's why those poll numbers look the way they do, Americans are getting it, and it's being communicated really clearly. GALLAGHER: Yes, it really is. Meantime, Whoopi Goldberg, Lydia Moynihan, gets the -- gets the silliest comment of the week award, and it's only Monday. She said the following. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WHOOPI GOLDBERG, HOST, ABC: You just got to keep your eyes open, you all. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. GOLDBERG: Because if they can just come up and take somebody, because they have made a decision that you are supposed to be that person, any one of us could find ourselves being deported. (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: They just come grab us. They just come grab us and take us away. Lydia. LYDIA MOYNIHAN, REPORTER, NEW YORK POST: I mean, Whoopi Goldberg is a performer. She's an actress. That's how she got her start, and that's what these comments are. There a performance. They're not based in reality. And you kind of think, after all the fearmongering we heard during the election, Democrats might take a moment and revisit and think, OK, the strategy isn't working. Maybe we should actually start being candid and honest and engage with the issues. Clearly, that has not happened, and that's not what's happening here. Again, immigration has been such a key issue for President Trump. (CROSSTALK) GALLAGHER: Yes. MOYNIHAN: It's, in many ways, why he was elected, and it's clearly extremely popular with the American people to make sure that we are getting rid of violent gang members. GALLAGHER: Right. Yes, indeed. Meantime, a little back and forth between Marco Rubio and Margaret Brennan about Mahmoud Khalil. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARCO RUBIO, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: If you tell us when you apply for a visa, I'm coming to the U.S. to participate in pro-Hamas events, that runs counter to the foreign policy interest of the United States of America. It's that simple. So, you lied. You came -- if you had told us that you were going to do that, we never would have given you the visa. Now, you're here. Now, you do it. You lied to us. You're out. It's that simple. It's that straight forward. MARGARET BRENNAN, SENIOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT, CBS NEWS: But is there any -- but is there any evidence of a link to terrorism? RUBIO: Yes. Sure. BRENNAN: Or is it just his point of view? RUBIO: Yes, they take over. I mean, do not -- I mean, you should watch the news. These guys take over entire buildings. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: Could have watched us. We said they were taking over buildings at Columbia for about two weeks, Dee. SARTON: I saw it right there, Trace. And I think that the American people are too. I mean, your numbers show that people are watching you. They are looking for that kind of insight into these issues. I call it a clarity rush that we are getting from the likes of Marco Rubio. We're getting the clear, concise answers going back to what I was saying before. And I think that, as journalists struggle with all of this, their bias seeps out into their tone. And again, that turns a lot of people off. It makes them search out outlets like you. (CROSSTALK) GALLAGHER: Yes. SARTON: And others that are telling and showing what you're showing here. That's what the truth is. GALLAGHER: Yes. Meantime, Lydia, let's play some news anchor versus politician, in Jake Tapper and Jasmine Crockett. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAKE TAPPER, CNN HOST: What's your issue with the U.S. using any tool at its disposal to remove undocumented, violent people from this country? REP. JASMINE CROCKETT (D-TX): We already have tools that are available to remove undocumented, violent people from our country. Giving them this wide latitude to just kind of go across and just claim that anybody is anything is wrong. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: What is the issue with removing violent people from the country, Lydia? I've got about 30 seconds for you. MOYNIHAN: Yes, Democrats have always chosen to take whatever side Trump takes, they want to take the opposite. Their entire message last eight years has been all about being against Trump. That's what Kamala ran on, that's what Joe ran on, and so, that's really the only message they know how to communicate. They are sticking with that. And unfortunately for them, taking the opposite side of Trump on a lot of these issues is kind of an impossible thing to message. And so, it seems clear here they just want to stand up to whatever Trump is doing. GALLAGHER: Yes. MOYNIHAN: And the reality is that, in this case, it makes absolutely no sense. GALLAGHER: Lydia Moynihan, Dee Sarton, thank you both. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: A $101 million for DEI contracts at the Department of Education, the most ever paid, nothing even like it. Under the Trump administration, all of these scams, and they're far worse, but I didn't think it was appropriate to talk about them. They're so bad. Many more have been found out and exposed and swiftly terminated by a group of very intelligent, mostly young people, headed up by Elon, and we appreciate it. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: Well, the battle over the future of the Department of Education is one of the fiercest fights the Trump administration is facing in its first 56 days. Let's bring in Fox News contributor and President Reagan's former education secretary, also the nation's first drug czar, and, as always, the smartest man in the room. Bill Bennet. Bill, it's great to have you on the show. You're not against getting rid of the Department of Education, but you do think there are parts of the Department of Education that are valuable. Explain that, Bill. BILL BENNETT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: Well, first of all, we did educate people before 1980 and 1979, in many ways, we were actually doing better before there was a department than now. And you get rid of a lot of its functions, send a lot of it to the states. Some of it, like the DEI stuff, just get rid of. But there are a couple of things it does that they are cutting, eliminating, and I've written to the secretary, Secretary McMahon, about it, that they shouldn't. One is the National Assessment of Educational Progress, the NAEP. This is where we have the scores, which we've heard the president cite. You've cited them. I've cited them. You know, reading scores, math scores, everybody wants to look at that. And you need them in order to have a barometer of how the country is doing in education, and also about whether how the states are doing. Because if you ask the states how they're doing, some states will -- (CROSSTALK) GALLAGHER: Yes. BENNETT: Remember, Garrison Keillor, all the men are intelligent, all the girls are pretty. GALLAGHER: Sure. BENNETT: You know, everybody is doing great. You know, according to these, lot of these state accounts, not all of them, but a lot of them. So, you need this test on the national level, to find out what we're really doing. (CROSSTALK) GALLAGHER: Yes. Yes. BENNETT: So, don't do away with that, please, Madam Secretary. GALLAGHER: Yes, and we look at -- the test scores have not been good in recent years, but it's a good -- Bill, you're right, a good barometer, Bill. Meantime, Brown University professor and physician, Rasha Alawieh was deported for attending the funeral of former Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah. Do you think we'll see more of these types of deportations in colleges, Bill? BENNETT: If we dig deeper, we will. And I think this is important. Presidents talked about looking at 60 universities. This is the cleansing of the academic stables, if you will, to remind everybody of Hercules and those labors. This is very important, because I believe you are going to find an awful lot of sympathizers with those causes and other causes on those campuses. You know, I believe not only the sinister effects of Tren de Aragua, but also the sinister deeper effects over time with the pollution of the intellectual environment, what was called in the 20s, the Tres son de Clerc, the treason of the clerks, the treason of the intellectuals. And when so many intellectuals went to the left, I think this had a lot to do with where we are today as a country, with the doubts about America, with a lot of the other stuff. So, I hope there is a deep cleansing of this. GALLAGHER: You talk about the left, Bill. I want to know what you think about the left standing up and saying that we should not be deporting people like Tren de Aragua, these violent gang members. Where are we, Bill? BENNETT: Kind of that's just crazy. I mean that they shouldn't be deported. Of course, they should. And I hope -- I hope, more of it. This will go up through the courts. Understand the court challenges, that's about all left has left to, you know, the counter, but we'll see. I imagine this will be upheld at higher level courts. And you got to get these guys out. I mean, the crimes these guys committed, unbelievable, unbelievable. The cleansing -- GALLAGHER: Yes. BENNETT: Again, it's another cleansing. This is what this president is. He's like, Mr. Clean here, when it comes to ideology, he gets rid of all of that. GALLAGHER: Yes. Bill Bennett, great to have you on the show as always, sir. Thank you for your time. We appreciate it. BENNETT: Happy St. Patrick's Day. I see your tie. My wife will be mad at me that I don't have one. GALLAGHER: Yes, she should be. BENNETT: She tried. She tried. GALLAGHER: She should be, Bill. Thanks. Bill, thanks very much. BENNETT: Oh, you son of a gun. GALLAGHER: We appreciate it. BENNETT: You -- OK. Thank you. GALLAGHER: Coming up. Have you noticed the same liberal judges keep getting assigned to Trump cases? Why is that? And is it legal? And for one night only, get yourself a cup of ""COMMON SENSE"". 20 percent off at the Fox News shop with the code PAT20. ""COMMON SENSE"" is Irish after all. Later in the ""NIGHTCAP"", as Democrat favorability craters to record lows and party in fighting increases, Democrats and the media suddenly fighting hard for violent gang members. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We're not sure that they are gang members, were just taking their word for it. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They have multiple men sleeping on concrete slabs without so much as a mattress or a sheet. ANDREW WEISSMANN, LEGAL ANALYST, MSNBC: This is over 200 years old. It has been rarely invoked. MILLER: A president has the ability to repel an invasion or predatory incursion that is directed by a foreign government. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: By a state or a government. Right? Are they a state or a government? MILLER: Yes, this would be -- yes, it is -- it is documented. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: What do you -- what do you think? Why is the left fighting to keep Tren de Aragua members and Hamas sympathizers in the country? Let us know. X and Instagram, @tracegallagher will read your responses, coming up in the ""NIGHT CAP"". We're coming right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GALLAGHER: Well, brand new information tonight about when two U.S. astronauts, stuck on the International Space Station will finally head home. The senior correspondent Jonathan Serrie, live for us at the Kennedy Space Center with more. Jonathan, good evening. JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Trace. Undocking is scheduled for 90 minutes from now, but preparations are already underway. In fact, moments ago, they closed the hatch to the SpaceX Dragon capsule, and moments from now, they'll be closing the hatch to the International Space Station allowing the capsule to bring home four members of the Crew 9 mission including Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams. They have been working on the space station since June when their Boeing Starliner spacecraft developed thruster problems. Former astronauts say after nine months in space, Butch and Suni, can expect an intense rehabilitation process to readjust to life on Earth. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Butch was a football player in college, Suni's pretty much a runner, so I'm going to guess that their work ethic's going to be just fine, right? They're going to be OK with working out two and a half hours a day. I just don't know how long it will take them to rehabilitate given their nine months in space. (END VIDEO CLIP) SERRIE: And, Trace, splashdown off the Gulf Coast of Florida is expected tomorrow evening, just before 6:00 p.m. Eastern time. NASA and SpaceX pushed it a day earlier because of a favorable weather forecast. Trace. GALLAGHER: Everybody's going to be watching Jonathan Sarian live for us on the Space Coast. Jonathan, thank you. Breaking tonight, a Dominican law enforcement source telling Fox News that Sudiksha Konanki's family officially informed police that they believe the witness Joshua Reby's story that their daughter drowned while the pair were swimming. The Konanki family has reportedly turned a declaration of death document into police, meaning if a Dominican court accepts the declaration, it would end any potential criminal suspicion of Reby. We'll have more on that story as it breaks. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEPHEN MILLER, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF FOR POLICY: Behind every single one of those terrorists was another future rape victim, another future sex trafficking victim, another future murder victim. People say, oh, it's an 18th century law. You know what else is an 18th century law? The Constitution of the United States. The Bill of Rights. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: Presidential advisor Stephen Miller defending the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport illegal Venezuelan migrants. Let's bring in Fix California Senior Advisor Attorney Katie Zacharia. Katie, it's great to have you on. We talked about the first judge, Beryl Howell. She blocked Trump's, Trump tried to go after the law firm Perkins Coie, right, because they handle a lot of Democratic cases. He wanted to go after them. She blocked that. It's interesting because the man who founded Article Three, Mike Davis, had this to say about Judge Howell. Oh, well, then let's read it. It says, ""Judge Beryl Howell is an Obama judge who previously served as a top aide to then Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy. She previously served as the supervising judge for Mueller's bogus Russian collusion investigation against President Trump. She is a partisan hack,"" says Mike Davis. The question is, how do they keep getting these cases, Katie? I mean, it's almost like you don't go to the back of the line, you just kind of go somewhere in the middle and they shuffle you right back to the top. KATIE ZACHARIA, FIX CALIFORNIA SENIOR ADVISOR: Yes. It seems really unlikely that this judge would continue to get these cases, right? She's had the Mueller probe. She's had the Jack Smith cases. She's the, she was overseeing one of the harshest January 6th sentencers. She did an unprecedented waiving of attorney-client privilege for President Trump. She was the chief judge in in this era. And so, I think the wider call is an investigation on how these judges are getting these cases in the D.C. circuit or in the D.C. court. GALLAGHER: It's amazing to me because you actually get to know their names. I mean, it's it's really unusual when you're like, oh, isn't that the judge that? And you're like, yes, it was. What, there are only three of them up there? Meantime, Elon Musk said this about Judge James Boasberg, who halted the deportation of Tren de Aragua members, quoting here: ""The very worst judges, those who repeatedly flout the law should at least be put to an impeachment vote whether that vote succeeds or not."" I mean, what he's saying, Katie, is people just shopping their cases. They know they're going to get a friendly judge, they just shop and find a good judge. ZACHARIA: And they continue to find judges that are adverse to President Trump's interest. They continue to rule against President Trump his executive orders. Congressman Brandon Gill called for the impeachment, again, I think it's a wider investigation into these both Chief Judge Boasberg and formerly Chief Judge Howell, need an investigation on how these cases are being distributed in the federal district court in D.C. GALLAGHER: You had Chuck Grassley saying today that you know what, they're going to get involved in this. The Senate Judiciary is going to get involved. Is it a good first step? ZACHARIA: I think it's a great first step. The Senate Judiciary has to get involved to give the American public confidence that their judiciary system is not weaponized, it's not a lawfare system, and that these imperial judges in D.C. are not going rogue against the American public's interests. GALLAGHER: I want to play some sound. This is Pam Bondi on Jesse Waters and I'll get your final thoughts on this. Watch. No sound. We don't have Pam. Never mind. Pam Bondi says, quoting here, ""They've invaded our country,"" she's talking about Tren de Aragua. And the question is, is who in the world wants these people here? Peo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 so who is the authority that oversees these judges that can keep these people in the country? ZACHARIA: The, the authority that's overseeing the judges is Congress or the D.C. Circuit particularly to Boasberg. However, I don't know an American citizen that wants these illegal criminals in our country. I think that this is the Democrats Party platform running away with the idea that anything pro-Trump is, is their platform. And so, I don't think that they're going to have an issue upholding this in the Supreme Court and that Tren de Aragua will remain in El Salvador for the foreseeable future. GALLAGHER: Yes. Katie, thank you. We appreciate it. Up next, an update, the breaking news we brought you at the top of the hour. It appears the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is over. And President Trump will speak with Vladimir Putin tomorrow. The breaking details on that are next. Don't go away. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GALLAGHER: Well, the president now warning that Iran could suffer consequences if the Houthi rebels continue attacking shipping vessels. The Trump administration targeted the Iran-backed group with airstrikes in Yemen over the weekend, killing at least 53 people. The Senior National Correspondent Rich Edson is live in D.C. with the breaking information on this. Rich, good evening. RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hi, good evening, Trace. President Trump says he's now holding the regime in Iran responsible for attacks by Houthi rebels in Yemen. The President posted this morning that," """"Every shot fired by the Houthis will be looked upon from this point forward as being a shot fired from the weapons and leadership of Iran"," and Iran will be held responsible and suffer the consequences and those consequences will be dire."""" The Iranian regime backs and supplies the Houthis. They've attacked merchant shipping in the Middle East from November of 2023 until this January. After American airstrikes against the Houthis", Saturday, the Pentagon says the group tried attacking the USS Harry Truman, but that they missed by more than a hundred miles. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEAN PARNELL, PENTAGON SPOKESMAN: The Houthis could stop this tomorrow if they said we're going to stop shooting at your people, but they've clearly chosen not to do that. And so, this campaign will be relentless to degrade their capability and to open up shipping lanes in the region and to defend our homeland. (END VIDEO CLIP) EDSON: The U.S. under the Biden administration and the U.K. began airstrikes against the Houthis last year. Trace. GALLAGHER: Rich Edson, live for us in D.C. Rich, thank you. Let's bring in the Foreign Desk Editor-in-Chief, Lisa Daftari, and Hudson Institute Senior Fellow, Rebeccah Heinrichs. Thank you both for coming on. Lisa, to you first. Here's the headline, big news, breaking news out of Israel. The Times of Israel says," """"IDF launching strikes throughout Gaza after Hamas refused repeated hostage deal offers."""" Ceasefires like this when they end they're very difficult to put back together. Fair? LISA DAFTARI", THE FOREIGN DESK EDITOR-IN-CHIEF: That's the reason why this fell apart. Look, Israel is observing that they're playing games. Hamas is playing games. They were not releasing hostages. They were not going to sign on to an extension of the currency as far as this was going to fall apart anyway. In the meantime, what was happening? Hamas was beefing up its assets, setting up for another October 7th. And look, Israel is a very different Israel with Trump in office. If only on October 8th of 2023, they had a better friend in the White House, I think this war would have looked very, very differently. And that's what we're seeing right now. Israel had to make a decision, of course. They had two priorities in this war, and they continue to have two priorities: to get the hostages back and to decimate Hamas. When it wasn't looking like they were going to get the hostages back, they had to go and decimate Hamas to the best of their ability, to diminish their abilities. GALLAGHER: Meantime, Rebeccah, speaking of ceasefires, President Trump said this yesterday about meeting Vladimir Putin, talking with him on the phone tomorrow. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, U.S. PRESIDENT: I'll be speaking to President Putin on Tuesday. Then, I'll be talking about land. It's a lot of land. It's a lot different than it was before the wars. We're already talking about that, dividing up certain assets. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: There were reports earlier, Rebecca, that the Trump administration agreed to allow Russia to recognize Crimea. The White House has knocked that down altogether. What do you think about the negotiations tomorrow? REBECCAH HEINRICHS, HUDSON INSTITUTE SENIOR FELLOW: Well, I can just note that President Trump is obviously being cautiously optimistic. I'm pleased to hear that the White House knocked down that reported claim that the United States would recognize Crimea as Russian. Of course, Crimea is Ukraine. Going back to 1940, the United States refuses to recognize any territory taken by aggression. And so, now, at this point we just got to see what the Russians are willing to do. They've been unwilling to stop its assault against Ukraine in order to even get to a ceasefire. The previous Trump administration had a stable relationship with the Russians only because it established deterrence. It had 8,000 troops, American troops we put into Poland. We supported European deterrence initiative inside of Europe. So, I'm looking forward to seeing what President Trump is willing to put on the table to compel the Russians to finally agree to a ceasefire. GALLAGHER: Meantime, on Truth Social, the president said this about the Houthi attacks," """"Any further attack or retaliation by the Houthis will be met with great force and there is no guarantee that"," that force will stop there."""" Clearly", he means there, meaning maybe Iran. What do you think about that? DAFTARI: Absolutely, look in the meantime while Hamas is playing games and while we're waiting for the next ceasefire, the Trump administration is getting to the root of the problem. It's not to go after the Houthis or Hezbollah or Hamas. These are all symptoms. The root of the problem is the Islamic Republic, the regime in Iran, which is the grand puppeteer, the grand funder of all the terrorism in the region, and he's giving them a very stern message. You will be next. GALLAGHER: Yes, I want to play some sound from Pam Bondi here, Rebecca, because I think it's interesting. She was on Jesse Water. She's talking about Tren de Aragua and she said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PAM BONDI, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: They have invaded our country. They are raping, they are murdering U.S. citizens, and they are coming here in mass numbers. And Donald Trump invokes the Alien Enemies Act just like he should and he has gotten rid of them. A lot, there are a lot more to go. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: I mean, Rebeccah, the Attorney General is right who is pushing for these people to stay here? HEINRICHS: No, it's unbelievable. I mean, these clearly are the most dangerous kind of criminals invading the United States. I think invasion is the right term to use. Guilty of conducting the most terrible, heinous crimes against Americans. And it's really terrorized communities where we know that they exist. And so, I think what the attorney general is trying to do in communicating is one, there's not going to be tolerated, they're going to be expelled from the country. But two, the American people have to regain confidence that they actually have law enforcement. That will put the security of the American people first. These criminals that we know exist here today came in from other countries and they're going to be exported. GALLAGHER: Yes. Rebecca Heinrichs, Lisa Daftari, thank you both. Well, as the Democratic Party hits record low favorability, it appears the next hill they'd like to die on is keeping violent gang members in the country. As you just heard. What do you think of that? Why on earth is the left fighting so hard to keep Tren de Aragua members and Hamas sympathizers in the country? Let us know, X and Instagram," @TraceGallagher. We're back with the """"NIGHTCAP"""" crew"," which includes you next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GALLAGHER: Back with the """"NIGHTCAP"""" crew: Rich Edson", Ashley Strohmier, Bill Melugin, Katie Zacharia, Mitch Rochelle, and Lisa Daftari. Tonight's topic, Hill to Die On. As the Democrat Party's infighting increases in their favorability craters to record lows, why is the left advocating to keep Tren de Aragua members and Hamas sympathizers in the country. What do you think, Rich Edson? EDSON: Well, you know, Trace, sometimes polls have a way of changing things, but Democrats are all over the map on this issue. Remember, this is the same party that also delivered a few dozen votes in Congress for the Laken Riley Act, something they've got to figure out before the midterms. GALLAGHER: Yes. Ashley. STROHMIER: You know, I just think the hate is so thick with them against Trump, and they've brainwashed themselves into thinking everything he does is bad, that they just cannot see clearly. It's that Trump derangement syndrome. Even when it comes to getting these violent criminals and gang members off American streets, they just don't care what he does. They don't agree with it. GALLAGHER: Yes. I mean, it's an automatic no for a lot of these people, Lisa. The whole thing is, doesn't matter what, and like he said in his speech, he could cure cancer or whatever, it doesn't matter. DAFTARI: It doesn't matter. It's poor leadership. The leaders that we saw in the poll are AOC and Bernie Sanders, and Kamala Harris, and they think they lost the election because they weren't far enough to the left. So, you're going to see these ideologies go farther and farther, but when it comes to the average American and when these, these issues come to their town whether it's crime, whether it's drugs, whether it's the economy, they think differently about these issues. GALLAGHER: Mitch. ROCHELLE: Listen, this is the party of virtue signaling. This is the party of people who got Teslas because electric cars were good and they were good for the environment, and now all of a sudden they're picketing Tesla. So, when your ideology is to virtue signal, you really don't have a policy. GALLAGHER: Really funny that you're picketing electric cars, Bill. MELUGIN: They seem to find themselves on the wrong end of every 80-20 issue. I would argue this is a 95-5 issue, the five only being Tren de Aragua gangbangers and the immigration attorneys who represent them. It's a head-scratcher. It doesn't make any sense. GALLAGHER: Katie? ZACHARIA: I think they should have stuck to Carville's advice as to stay quiet or play possum and rather than double down on these policies of keeping violent gang members in the country.

FOX NEWS @ NIGHT is next. I'm Greg Gutfeld. I love you America. TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF BREAKING NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening. I'm Trace Gallagher, it's 11:00 p.m. on the East Coast, 8:00 here in Los Angeles, and this is America's late News, FOX NEWS @ NIGHT. And breaking tonight, the anti-Israel, anti-police protest continuing at Barnard College in New York now in their ninth day after nine demonstrators were arrested when police responded to a bomb threat, but protesters didn't appear to be all that grateful. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: NYPD help us out. Take your gun and shoot yourself. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: Plus, a new message from Hamas after President Trump issued his last warning to the terrorist group, telling them to release the hostages or they're dead. And wouldn't you know it, during his first podcast, California Governor Gavin Newsom learning to lean right on the issue of transgender athletes with a major split from his party, watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHARLIE KIRK, CONSERVATIVE ACTIVIST: Would you say no men in female sports? GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D-CA): Well, I think it's an issue of fairness. I completely agree with you on that. It is an issue on fairness. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: Meantime, President Trump says the golden age of America has begun with DOGE continuing to slice and dice the wasteful spending in federal government. The Senior National Correspondent Kevin Corke is live in D.C. with a tally of whose winning and who's losing. Kevin, good evening. KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Evening, Trace. It all depends on your perspective. For example, Trump's golden age begins with a brutal trade war. That was the latest headline from the Wall Street Journal. So, you sort of see how they're viewing this particular circumstance. They say this is a terror fueled reset of the U.S.'s trading relationship with its two closest neighbors, Mexico and Canada. But the White House says the journal and others who are complaining about this new golden age are really missing a fundamental point. Fact is, the U.S. has already been the subject of onerous tariffs and taxes and other restrictions from frankly, all over the globe, including Mexico and Canada that prevent American companies from competing and having fair market access. Thus a brand new approach in Trump 2.0 in the hopes, say White House officials, of solving a decades long problem that very few Americans may have noticed before. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Well, a lot of them are globalist countries and companies that won't be doing as well because we're taking back things that have been taken from us many years ago, we've been treated very unfairly as a country. We protect everybody. CORKE (voice over): All part of a very busy Trump Thursday, when which we saw more tariff delays from Mexico and Canada. The president announcing on some Mexican and Canadian goods. Those tariffs will be delayed until April 2nd. He also signed more executive orders, including one for a strategic Bitcoin reserve and digital asset stockpile. Pretty cool. (END VIDEO CLIP) COLLINS (on camera): Meantime, in a post on Truth Social, the president also said he's instructed his secretaries in leadership in the cabinet to work with DOGE, as you mentioned, on those cost cutting measures and staffing, so they can be more precise. You know, figuring out who stays and who goes using a quote scalpel rather than a hatchet, part of the promised golden age of America, Trace. GALLAGHER: Kevin Corke live for us in D.C. Kevin, thank you. Let's bring in Fox News Contributor Steve Hilton and Magnify Media Partners' CEO, political strategist, Taylor Strand. Thank you both for coming on. Taylor, to you first, Trump made it very clear to his Cabinet members today that they are in charge. Elon is not in charge. But Elon was in the meeting, and here's what the president said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: But I want them to do the best job they can where we have good people, those that's precious, that's very important, and we want them to keep the good people. And so, we're going to be watching them, and Elon and the group are going to be watching them, and if they can cut, it's better. And if they don't cut, then Elon will do the cutting. (END VIDEO CLIP) COLLINS: Elon was in the room. It's not really a swipe at him. In fact, he's sitting there like this is kind of what I want. You know, I want to have oversight, but I don't want to be the main guy. TAYLOR STRAND, CEO, MAGNIFY MEDIA PARTNERS: Right. Well, you know, what's amazing is, if Joe Biden had brought in Mark Cuban to oversee an audit government waste, you would not hear one Democrat talking about, you know, that the -- sorry, you wouldn't hear one Democrat talking about, sorry, you wouldn't hear one Democrat talking about how we're trying to cut grandma's Social Security. GALLAGHER: Right. Yes, no, you wouldn't hear -- you wouldn't hear anything about that. That's exactly what happens. But now you do, because Elon Musk is involved. Steve Hilton, now there's a hold on tariffs. Fox News writes the following, President Trump on Thursday exempted most goods from Canada and Mexico covered under the U.S., Mexico, Canada agreement from his 25 percent tariffs for the next month. The tariffs went into effect earlier this week and will now be reinstated on April 2nd. Very quick turnaround here, Steve, I mean, you know, he was like yesterday, no, they're staying. Now they're gone. What do you think is the reaction? What's the reasoning for that? STEVE HILTON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: In the middle of those changes, you have real negotiations happening in real time, phone calls with the -- with the various leaders of these countries. And so, the decisions reflect those positions. I think it's very important in this whole conversation about tariffs to remember a couple of things. First, he has a mandate for this. He couldn't have been clearer in the campaign over and over, speech after speech, tariff man, what a beautiful word. So, people may not like it, but the people of America voted for it. Secondly, it is a big change. And so, just as you see with big reforms over the years, where you're turning over from the past way of doing things, we got to give it time. We got to see how this works out. But he's got a mandate for it, and he really believes in it, and we'll see what happens. GALLAGHER: And leaders of both the countries, by the way, you had Mexico and you had Canada, were both on the phone, were both like, you know what? Let's talk this out before we get -- before we do anything. So, kind of you move in that direction. Meantime, Al Green being censured. And then -- and then Democrats singing on the House floor. Watch this. Top to bottom. Watch it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): And that Representative Al Green be censured with public reading of this resolution by the speaker. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: I mean, Taylor, we go back and we go to Tuesday night. There was a lot of kind of antics going on there, but you go back weeks, and the Democrats just appear to be lost. They're like in limbo, right? STRAND: They're so out of touch with the American people. I mean, the mandate was clear in this last election, what the American people want, and now we've got a president who actually has solutions to these problems, and all you see is the Democrats whining and complaining, and it's just a nonstarter, and they're probably getting less viewers than the Kennedy Center has up until this year. GALLAGHER: Yes, that's probably a fair assessment. Peter Doocy asking Trump when we get information about the assassinations, and the president said the following, watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: It's been seven months. Why do you think we don't know more about the guy who shot you in the ear? TRUMP: Yes, no, well, and the second one with all of his cell phone so I want to find the answers, I told them. In fact, today, I said I want to fight. We can no longer blame Biden for that one. He should have released that a long time ago. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: Yes. I mean, that's the whole thing, David. You're like, where's the information? And it's his administration. So, he wants it out. HILTON: I've got to say, that is a perfect example of why this president, Donald Trump, is such a refreshing change, that is exactly the opposite of what you get from a normal machine politician who's constantly on the defensive and saying what there's some aid has written out from, he's just telling the truth. He's saying, yes, I want to know as well. And he's not just going to defend automatically, everything that every single piece of the government bureaucracy does, because he's actually almost like the outsider pushing the bureaucracy on this issue and on DOGE and all the rest of it. It's such a refreshing change. GALLAGHER: Yes, Steve Hilton, Taylor Strand, thank you both. Well, it appears the Democrats have done it again, reaching a new cringe worthy low in their latest awkward attempt to reach young voters. Christina Coleman is live with what many would call disturbing new images. Christina, good evening. CHRISTINA COLEMAN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Trace. Disturbing cringy, bizarre. Check out this choose your fighter video with House Democrats half squatting or bouncing in their pretend fighter positions. Of course, it didn't take long for this weird video to go viral and get heavily criticized in the process. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RILEY GAINES, 'GAINES FOR GIRLS' PODCAST HOST: This is cringy. This is out of touch. This is -- and that's what the Democrats have proven themselves to be time and time and time again. DOUG SCHOEN, DEMOCRATS STRATEGIST: Right now, the party is unrecognizable, has no message, has no strategy, is rudderless, and frankly, I thought was embarrassing itself with its behavior. COLEMAN (voice over): Also at least two dozen Democrats shared this profanity laden video of themselves reading from the same script and claiming some of the things the president says are not true. TRUMP: When I win, I will immediately bring prices down, starting on day one. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): (EXPLETIVE DELETED) that isn't true. SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ): (EXPLETIVE DELETED) that isn't true. SEN. TAMMY DUCKWORTH (D-IL): (EXPLETIVE DELETED) that isn't true. COLEMAN (voice over): Are they pretending to be cool? What's happening here? Not sure the cursing is going to resonate with voters. Meantime, the Trump White House reacted to the Democrats' cringey choose your fighter video by posting their own video that reads, America chose its fighters last November, take a look. (END VIDEOTAPE) COLEMAN (on camera): Now, that's a cool video, Trace. GALLAGHER: That was a cool one. Christina, thank you. Well, the FOX NEWS @ NIGHT Common Sense Department thinks the Democratic Party is now living at the tail end of the Bonnie Raitt song, I Can't Make You Love Me, where the lyrics say, ""Morning will come and I'll do what's right. Just give me till then to give up this fight."" Truth is, Democrats gave up the fight a while ago, and they won't get it back by posting embarrassing videos asking voters to choose their fighter. When they asked to be, asking voters to choose the leaders what the question should be, because for now, the party is leaderless, and therefore it's rudderless. Tim Walz was asked on CNN who the leader of the Democratic Party is, Walz paused and then stumbled and never really issued a proper response. Common Sense thinks that's because there is no proper response. There is no proper leader. Would a proper leader condone Jasmine Crockett answering a simple question with foul language simply because social media favors debacle over debate? I mean, why play by the rules when your followers prefer chaos? Why stand with heroes when you can side with criminals? Why cry for victims when you can virtue signal in silence? Common Sense likes it when Bonnie Raitt sings the part that says, ""Tell me no lies. Just hold me close. Don't patronize."" Good lyrics, good advice. Maybe the Democrats would learn, you can't make them love you if they don't. Let's bring in Date Right Stuff Chief Marketer -- Marketing Officer, Raquel Debono and The Federalist Elections Correspondent, Brianna Lyman, thank you both for coming on. Raquel, to you first. Let's watch a little of the Democrats and this choose your fighter video. I mean, it's worth watching, look. Now is your time to go rock out, but I think it's really kind of like me and social media. It's a little clumsy. What do you think of that? RAQUEL DEBONO, CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER, DATE RIGHT STUFF: It's a really embarrassing it's like an 80-year-old man trying to be relevant on TikTok, but instead you have AOC who's just dying to remain relevant. I mean, the only thing AOC has ever fought for is tampons in men's bathrooms. GALLAGHER: Here's Jasmine Crockett on Trump making Black people go back to the fields. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JASMINE CROCKETT (D-TX): They have decided to go after immigrants and these and things like that. And they've said, oh, they're taking your Black jobs. They taking your Black jobs, not really. They are obviously jobs that they want us to go back to, such as work in the fields. All right, those immigrants that come into our country, they work the fields, something that we haven't done in a long time. And clearly he is trying to make us go back to the fields. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: I mean, I think she works on this, Brianna, it seems like each day it's more ridiculous. It gets more views and whatever is hitting on social media, she just goes with. BRIANNA LYMAN, ELECTIONS CORRESPONDENT, THE FEDERALIST: You know, part of the reason that Donald Trump wants to deport illegal immigrants is to protect Black American workers. Illegal immigrants are not just working in the fields like Crockett says. They work in the health care, home aid industry, they work in the restaurant industry. They work in construction. And their presence in the labor market actually undercuts American workers, including the workers Crockett claims to care about. And in 2010, Obama's Civil Rights Commission released a report that found that six in 10 adult Black males had a high school diploma or less and were disproportionately employed in the low skilled labor sector, and as a result, they were competing with illegal immigrants. So, when Donald Trump talks about deporting people, he's talking about protecting workers who are being disproportionately impacted by the illegal immigrants in joining in our workforce. GALLAGHER: Yes, it really is. And Senator Casey Weinstein, he's a state senator from Ohio, by the way, Casey Weinstein, he posted this, quoting here, ""To the bigoted terrorists of Libs of TikTok targeting my kids' school, our children and our teachers in Hudson: stay the hell out of our town."" Libs of TikTok responded, saying, State Senator Casey Weinstein, Democrat just defamed me and called me a bigoted terrorist because I posted about a school in his district sneaking in DEI. I mean, when did calling out DEI programs all the sudden qualify as being a bigot, Raquel? DEBONO: Apparently, asking common questions and common sense questions is just tragic to these people. I mean, when the Democrats don't know what to say, they yell DEI, DEI, racism, and it's just classic democratic playbook. GALLAGHER: Yes, we talked about this in Common Sense, Brianna, but I want to play Tim Walz. This is him on CNN, and he was asked who he thinks the Democratic leader is, watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Sir, who do you think the leader of the Democratic Party is right now? GOV. TIM WALZ (D-MN): I think the voting public right now is what I would say and I keep telling that. We're not going to have a charismatic leader right in here and save us from this. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: I mean, he ran with a woman named Kamala Harris. Maybe that was a question or an answer you should have given. He got stumped, Brianna. LYMAN: Yes, I think the better question isn't who is the messenger, it's what is the message? Because Democrats don't have a message, and that is the main problem. We saw that become true in 2024. They got rid of Joe Biden because they said he wasn't going to effectively carry the Democrat message. They replaced him with Kamala, who ran on the exact same platform. Even told ""The View"" she wouldn't change a thing and she lost. So, it's not a problem of the messenger. It's a problem of the message. GALLAGHER: Yes. Brianna Lyman, Raquel Debono, thank you both. Well, despite an ominous new warning from the President, Hamas is still refusing to release more hostages without Israel implementing phase two of a cease fire deal. Chanley Painter is live in New York with more on the diplomatic back and forth. Chanley, good evening. CHANLEY PAINTER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Hi. Good evening, Trace. The terror group raisingly dismissing Trump's ultimatum demanding Hamas, in part, ""Release all of the hostages now, immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is over for you."" Hamas responded, they will not release any more Israeli hostages without a permanent cease fire deal in Gaza and threatened, in part, ""Any escalation of aggression against our people will result in the killing of enemy captives."" The back and forth coming after the president met with eight former Israeli hostages, he has confirmed that the U.S. envoy to the Middle East is engaging in discussions with Hamas about a second phase of the cease fire. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: Biden wasn't able to get anybody out. We came along and it started releasing but we have 59 left of which 24 are living. Meanwhile, here in New York, more pro-Palestinian protests at Barnard College with masked students taking over another campus building, where just yesterday, nine of them were arrested in a chaotic scene after a bomb threat. The agitator sparked by the expulsion of students who disrupted a history of modern Israel class on January 21st. Now, these protests continue as Trump made clear earlier this week, federal funding will be cut off for any university allowing these illegal protests, Trace. GALLAGHER: Chanley Painter live for us in New York. Chanley, thank you. Let's bring in UCLA student Eli Tsives and Israeli Special Ops veteran, Aaron Cohen, thank you both for coming on. Aaron, to you first. Trump said this about getting the hostages out today. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What does that mean in your eyes? Is that military action? Would you join strikes with Israel? TRUMP: Only for you to (ph) find out. We have 59 left, of which 24 are living, the rest are dead. And we -- I put out a statement, it's sort of self-explanatory, I think, but somebody's going to have to get a lot rougher than they're getting. It's a shame. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: The question was, any chance the U.S. joins in these strikes there? What do you think about that? I mean, he didn't really answer, but he said, they need to get tougher. What's the answer? AARON COHEN, ISRAELI SPECIAL OPS VETERAN: So, I don't know what the Americans can do to Gaza and to Hamas that Israel hasn't already done. So, the question now becomes, how do you eradicate Hamas? How do you get the hostages out? Here's where I'm at with that. I think it's time to have an honest conversation about how to kill Hamas for good. The only way to get to Hamas without hitting these civilians who have effectively become part of the hostage siege, Trace, is to completely move the Gazans and force an evacuation into the southern peninsula of the Sinai and move them out completely and spread them out amongst the Arab countries and have them support it and make sure there's no Hamas within those ranks. But at that point, once they're all out, then you can start to de radicalize, and I've talked about this with you before, but really got to move the civilians out. Then it's time to destroy Gaza once and for all. That's where I'm at. GALLAGHER: Meantime, Fox News headline, Eli says, quoting here, NYPD makes multiple arrests at Barnard College after anti-Israel agitators take over, and then Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, had the following to say, listen to him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JONATHAN GREENBLATT, CEO, ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE: We're dealing with a surge of anti-Semitic incidents, the likes of which we've never seen before, and the locus for it are college campuses. And in particular, Columbia University has been sort of ground zero for this, not just anti-Jewish, this anti-American, this anti-Western movement. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: Ground zero. And it's getting worse, Eli. ELI TSIVES, UCLA STUDENT: Absolutely, Trace. And you know what we need to do? We need to do is we need to teach these students a lesson, and the only way to do that is with strict force. If you break a law, you get in trouble for it, the police takes you away. If you break a school rule, you get expelled. That is the only way these students will learn. GALLAGHER: Yes, it really is. Meantime, the hostages meeting with Trump today, he's involved in this, but I want you to listen to some of the hostages and their and their stories of what happened, followed by the president. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I've been suffered from starvation, violence and humiliations daily. One time they broken my ribs and I'm so hurt, I couldn't breathe for one month. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My little brother is still in there. TRUMP: I mean, I've saved a lot of people, but I've never seen anything like this, where you lived under those conditions. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: He heard those stories, Aaron, and that's why he's pissed, and that's why he's saying to Hamas, it's now, I need these people out now. COHEN: Yes, and I feel where he's coming from, and it's very heartbreaking to see this footage of these hostages coming out. Here's what -- here's what I think, Trace. Hamas is never going to release all the hostages. They were never going to release all the hostages. And the reason why, because the moment they lose the hostages card, the camera is no longer on them, and they lose relevance. Which takes us back to solution A again, which is, how do you get these hostages back. Hamas needs to feel like Israel almost doesn't care about them, just to the point where move the Gazans, finish Gaza, completely level it. Meanwhile, we start picking away wherever the hostages may be remaining, and integrate. Nobody does with special operations better than Israel, Trace. Let him start picking that apart. But you've got to look at the bigger picture. Got to get Hamas out of there. GALLAGHER: Daily Wire says there are overwhelming facts, Eli, evidence and testimony proving that the University of California allowed a hostile environment on its campuses and failed to protect their employees from anti- Semitic tropes and attacks. TSIVES: I couldn't agree more. It was a very, very tough situation on U.C. campuses, especially UCLA. Last year, the encampment was terrible. They were denying Jewish students access through certain parts of campus. Jewish students were being harassed for wearing Magen Davids and Kippahs. And what was going on was absolutely horrific, but I will say, though, that UCLA has gotten a lot better. We have a new chancellor who has done a lot for Jewish students. He even suspended the student's justice for Palestine group, which is a pure anti-Semitic movement. So, we're seeing progress. GALLAGHER: We have indeed. Eli, Aaron, thank you both. Coming up, President Trump highlighting all the government waste DOGE has uncovered. But not everyone in D.C. quite understands. FOX NEWS @ NIGHT hit the streets, spreading a little common sense. And later in the Nightcap, Democrats sparking debate over their recent methods of speaking out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Choose your fighter. SCHUMER: (EXPLETIVE DELETED) that isn't true. BOOKER: (EXPLETIVE DELETED) that isn't true. DUCKWORTH: (EXPLETIVE DELETED) that isn't true. SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA): (EXPLETIVE DELETED) that isn't true. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: Has the left found an effective way to stand up to the GOP or just embarrass themselves? Let us know, X and Instagram @TraceGallagher, we'll read your responses in the Nightcap. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GALLAGHER: Well, for the second time in two months, an unmanned SpaceX test flight ended with an explosion just minutes after liftoff, the latest starship rocket was scheduled for an hour long space skimming flight, but eight minutes into the flight, the engines began shutting down, contact was lost, and the craft went into an out of control spin before exploding with wreckage scenes streaming down from the skies over Florida. In fact, Florida airports were put under temporary ground stops because of the debris that you were looking at. Meantime, our intrepid DOGE producer, Jillie was out and about in our nation's capital last night, this time, sampling the swamps' reaction to the president's address to Congress, how Democrats conducted themselves and some of the surprising points Trump scored with his common sense. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JILLIE: Did you watch Donald Trump speech to Congress last night? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, I do my best to ignore her. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I did. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I did. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I did not. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, I did. JILLIE: What were your thoughts? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You really want the truth? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Overall, it was a pretty good speech. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: None. JILLIE: Not a fan of Trump. Why so? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Just don't care for him. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You know, that victimization stuff that he does, it's just a little tired. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Don't like the guy. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's a traitor, and not the traitor on Peacock. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I hope. JILLIE: Great show. Great show. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm a faithful. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I, I, I, I, which is the typical Donald Trump. JILLIE: So, in the speech, he mentioned that he and his team found over a million people over the age of 150 registered to Social Security. TRUMP: We have a healthier country than I thought, Bobby. JILLIE: Do you know anyone aged 150 years old? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Uh, do you? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The oldest person I know alive is 101. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, where's this money going to, who? So, why aren't they investigating that? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They are. That's what they're doing. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think there's much more important things to do first, like figure out why Elon Musk is going through all of our information. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The Democrats sat there, didn't stand up, didn't applaud at finding the fraud in Social Security, why is that? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, they obviously have an issue with Donald Trump. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They also didn't clap for the little kid with brain cancer. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He also mentioned $8 million going towards LGBTQIA- plus efforts in Lesotho. You ever heard of Lesotho? TRUMP: Which nobody has ever heard of. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, I don't know what the hell that is. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I've never heard of that country. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I wish my bank account was Lesotho. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't know why we'd be spending that kind of money on that particular issue. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You like your tax dollars going there? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That is a terrible place for my tax dollars. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He's making sure your taxpayer dollars aren't going towards that. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, that's good. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I mean, he is like the president of America, so like, it would be, you know, it'd make more sense if he spent that money towards America, I guess. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: $40 million was going towards social and economic inclusion of sedimentary migrants. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: OK. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you know what that is? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No. TRUMP: Nobody knows what that is. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are we including Elon Musk in that? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Common sense, yes or no. Having someone at the age of 360 years old getting social security benefits? TRUMP: More than 100 years older than our country. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well, no. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Common sense that we don't give $8 million towards LGBTQIA-Plus efforts in the African country of Lesotho? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, I definitely agree with that. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Probably, yes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you have any common sense, you see that that's insane. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That makes sense. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think you have a bit of common sense. All right, Trace. We found some more common sense here tonight in the D.C. swamp. New member, Common Sense Department. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, this is great, I love it. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We're trying to bring common sense back to the D.C. swamp. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. Yes! (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: And the hats are flying out the building. Meantime there is continuing fallout from the Democrats behavior at the president's address to Congress. Let's bring in a Michigan auto worker and former Democrat who attended the event, Joseph Knowles. Joseph, great to have you on. I want to play a little sound from Piers Morgan on ""FOX AND FRIENDS"" today about the Democrats' performance. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PIERS MORGAN, PIERS MORGAN UNCENSORED HOST: The Democrats have got to take a good long hard look at themselves because the stupid signs, they're not getting up for the poor families of these murdered people, the way they treated that boy, the walkouts, the silly Instagram stuff afterwards. Look at me, I didn't go in. This is the President of the United States speaking. What's going on? In the heart of politics. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: Do you feel for your former party, Joseph? JOSEPH KNOWLES, MICHIGAN AUTO WORKER: I don't feel for them. What you saw, what everyone saw yesterday was emotions. You saw the Democrats displaying how they, their emotions yesterday. Oh, I'm sorry, Wednesday. So, it was actually, what you saw was Democrats displaying their inner self. I was there and I saw while Donald Trump was speaking about his policies and talking about these victims that's been, you know, the victims of tragedy. You saw Bernie Sanders on his phone the whole time. He never looked up, never looked up to them victims. I saw, you know, because I saw Elizabeth Warren sit next to him, had no interest of what Trump was saying, she had no interest of what the victims was going through because the American people didn't know a lot of these things, and they had absolutely no interest. And I was embarrassed because -- go ahead, I'm sorry. GALLAGHER: I just wanted to put this on the Politico insider poll it, quoting here, insider poll, ""The Democratic Party has lost its way as the plurality of voters, 40 percent, said the Democratic Party doesn't have any strategy whatsoever for responding to Trump. According to the survey by the liberal firm blueprint that was shared first with Politico, another 24 percent said Democrats have a game plan but it's a bad one. A paltry 10 percent said that the party has a solid technique for dealing with Trump and that's coming from a Democratic outfit survey."" 10 percent think the Dems have a plan. KNOWLES: They don't have a plan. If they have a plan they will never react to the way they did yesterday, Tuesday. They don't a plan. They really are fishing right now, they're fishing to see what the American people are reacting to. When you saw Al, Al Green outbursts that's not a plan. When you see Bernie doing after his speech, you saw Bernie do his speech and you saw the Democratic from Michigan, I don't know her name she just got elected. When you saw them they all doing speeches trying to justify their action. They don't have a plan. Really, what they try to do display on the hearts of American. We've been -- me, as a Democrat, as a former Democrat, I have been abused emotionally by them. GALLAGHER: Yes, a lot of people are saying exactly the same. Yes, that's what a lot of people have said, Joseph. Thank you so much for coming on. We appreciate your time. We're running out of time here, Sir, but we very much appreciate you coming in and giving us your perspective on thi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 coming up, why is California Governor Gavin Newsom all of the sudden in favor of protecting girls sports from transgender athletes with a catch, of course. And what else did he say in his new podcast, is it the first step in a 2028 presidential run? (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GALLAGHER: Well, President Trump's new Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Scott Turner, is in Los Angeles to get a first-hand look at the massive destruction caused by recent wildfires and he allowed FOX NEWS @ NIGHT producer, Natalie Reddington, to join him for an exclusive ride- along. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SCOTT TURNER, SECRETARY OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT: We have to be swifter in our action and so the regulatory environment, bad policies, disengagement, mismanagement, all of those things have to go and so I'm excited. Palisades and Altadena, what can we do for you? Because at the end of the day, it's the people. It may be in different neighborhoods, but they all want the American dream to rebuild their families. I'm excited what we can do in partnering here with Altadena, with the Palisades, and with these families to get results quicker. We did announce the extension, 90-day extension, on the foreclosure moratorium, and this will give families flexibility to rebuild. The administration is committed to help the families here that have been victims of the devastation. We're huddling up and running new plays because the American people spoke. 77 million people voted for President Trump because they want change. It's heartbreaking but the resolve of the people here in Altadena is one that will encourage every American. I believe that as we come together as a team, as the American people. And I know the president would feel and say the same, that there's nothing that we cannot overcome. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: And now we move on to Gavin Newsom's first podcast with Charlie Kirk sitting in the opposite chair. Let's bring in Fox 11 News Anchor Elex Michaelson, and LAGOP Central Committee Member Elizabeth Barcohana. Thank you so much for coming in. Here is Newsom, the big bite that went viral today on, he was asked by Charlie Kirk about the whole males in female sports, and he said the following. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Would you do something like that? Would you say no men in female sports? GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D-CA): Well, I think it's an issue of fairness. I completely agree with you on that. It is an issue of fairness. So, it's deeply unfair. Would you speak completely fair on the issue of fairness? I completely agree. So, that's easy to call out, the unfairness of that. There's also humility and grace that these poor people are more likely to commit suicide, have anxiety and depression. And the way that people talk down to vulnerable communities is an issue that I have a hard time with as well. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: So, he does what Gavin Newsom does a lot, which is, you know, he's like, yes, OK, I agree with you, but, but, but there's always this other side. He's got to get both sides in. What did you think of the interview? ELIZABETH BARCOHANA, LAGOP CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEMBER: So, he's -- Gavin Newsom said that he wanted to change the conversation just a day or so ago we were talking about how every single Democrat senator voted against protecting women's sports. And today here we are the heir apparent for 2028 on the Democrat side saying that actually is acknowledging the reality that, yes, it is unfair to have biological men in women's sports, but it's not only unfair, it's unsafe too. Peyton McNabb is a volleyball player. She's sustained a traumatic brain injury because a biological man spiked a volleyball right into her face. Women's spaces also is a huge issue for them. GALLAGHER: Right. BARCOHANA: And he sat there, the infuriating thing about this interview is that he sat there talking about giving pronouns in school and pornography in curriculum, and teachers transitioning kids behind their parents' back as if he had really no idea that this was going on. He's the one who signed those bills. GALLAGHER: You spoke with Charlie Kirk after the interview and about that exchange and he said the following. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHARLIE KIRK, TURNING POINT USA: He just bluntly said look, I agree with you, it's about fairness. He's already receiving a lot of backlash by local leaders here in California for that position, and we'll see if he actually follows up that rhetoric with action like an executive order or trying to champion the state bill that will prohibit biological men and women's sports. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: He didn't totally agree, he partly agreed with him. ELEX MICHAELSON, FOX 11 NEWS ANCHOR: Yes, but he went farther than almost any other national Democrat has, and he's went farther than he has before. And Charlie Kirk said that he was surprised that Gavin Newsom agreed with him as quickly as he did, that he didn't necessarily push back on that issue and didn't really give as much of a nuanced answer on it, basically just saying, yes, I agree. And you look at the politics of this. Gavin Newsom reads polls pretty well. He knows it's an 80-20 issue. 80 percent of the country is with both Charlie Kirk and with Gavin Newsom. So, it may be smart politics for Newsom to side with the 80 and to maybe kick the 20 when a lot of people in the middle of the country don't like the 20 that much. GALLAGHER: One more. I got to go quickly on this one. I'll play one more site between, sound between let's play the -- Gavin Newsom and Charlie Kirk. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KIRK: You guys have not built intellectual muscle over 30 years because you all agree with each other all the time. NEWSOM: Well, not like conservatives are or massively disagree on. Trump has completely collapsed. KIRK: I would, I would push back a little bit. I would disagree. We have all robust discussion. NEWSOM: It seems like Congress is really doing great oversight of Trump right now. They're just holding him to account. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: Yes, like they are. Look, they control Congress, the Republicans, and that's what people voted for. BARCOHANA: That's absolutely what people voted for. And you know, conservatives are hardened a little bit. We, we disagree with each other and we also take a lot of incoming fire and criticism. So, we're able to kind of engage in this conversation in a way that Democrats struggle with. GALLAGHER: Yes, one more, you and Charlie Kirk. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KIRK: I think it's very interesting that at this moment where the Democrats are kind of in the wilderness, they're looking for their own political leader, seems as if Governor Newsom wants to try to position him as the moderate. I think he's been a total failure as governor, we could talk about it if you'd like, but at the very least from a rhetorical standpoint, he's starting to say things that would make the Democrat Party more palatable to the rest of the country. (END VIDEO CLIP) GALLAGHER: Terrible governor, palatable to the nation. MICHAELSON: We'll see if that happens, but it maybe is a smart political strategy. Bill Clinton did this in the past. Barack Obama tried to go to the middle in the past. That's typically where Democrats win. GALLAGHER: Well, especially now. I mean, they've kind of found that out. Elex, Elizabeth, thank you both. Well, recent Democrat tactics have Americans wondering, has the left found a compelling way to fight back or are they just embarrassing themselves? Let us know, X and Instagram," @TraceGallagher. We're coming back with the """"NIGHTCAP"""" crew including you next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) GALLAGHER: Back with the """"NIGHTCAP"""" crew: Chanley Painter", Kevin Corke, Christina Coleman, Steve Hilton, Aaron Cohen, and Elizabeth Barcohana. Tonight's topic, fight or flop? Democrats under scrutiny for how they've recently chosen to get their message across. Do you like what they're doing? Is it effective or are they just embarrassing themselves? Kevin Corke. CORKE: Just stop. Come on. I'll leave it at that. I'll be kind. Don't do it. GALLAGHER: Yes. Chanley Painter. PAINTER: Yes, Trace representing the American people should never look like an SNL skit. GALLAGHER: Yes, it really is. I mean the whole thing is Christina Coleman, when you look at, when you when you see the paddles and you see all the memes and all the social media things, they got burned on social media for doing it but they did it anyway. COLEMAN: That thing ripped all over the Internet. It's hilarious I mean, this is a bad week for Democrats and what does it say that you have to put a video out cursing over and over and over again? Is that how you connect with voters, the American people? GALLAGHER: Yes, I mean, I said it. I, Jasmine Crockett, hey, what do you think about Elon Musk and she the -- I just don't get it. COHEN: It's embarrassing. You know, when you're putting performative stunts over leadership, it's just kind of sad what's happened. The Democratic Party is sort of falling apart. GALLAGHER: Steve Hilton. HILTON: So, if I had a little paddle, what would be written on that. You're all a total joke. That's what I would write. GALLAGHER: Yes, it's a fair assessment. Elizabeth? BARCOHANA: I think it's amazing. I think they should keep doing what they're doing. It's going wonderful. I am enjoying retweeting all of the Democrats who are writing manifestos about why they are leaving the Democratic Party and re-registering them as Republicans. I love it. Keep it going.

The senators are hunkering down for a vote-a-rama, marathon voting session on amendments on big issues surrounding the budget blueprint for President Trump's second administration. We talk with Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Tom Cotton about the news of the day and his new book, ""Warning About China"". And a hockey border war in Boston. The U.S. hosts Canada for the 4 Nations final, with fireworks expected between the two teams. But first, ""BREAKING TONIGHT,"" another step in the Trump administration's efforts to end the Ukraine war. President Trump's envoy meeting today with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv, though there are some lingering tensions. We'll bring you there. Plus, questions now about whether you could get a refund check? Thanks to the Department of Government Efficiency. We could hear more about this when President Trump speaks with Republican governors in about an hour and a half. Senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy starts us off tonight, as he often does live from the North Lawn. Good evening, Peter. PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. The hold up in the peace process tonight, Ukraine still hasn't agreed to a deal to give the United States Access to rare earth minerals in exchange for future security guarantees. Here at the White House today, President Trump also sat in on a meeting about a possible merger of the PGA Tour and LIV Golf. And then, this happened. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Tiger! Tiger! AMERICAN CROWD: Tiger! Tiger! DOOCY (voice over): As President Trump celebrates Black History Month with Tiger Woods -- TIGER WOODS, PROFESSIONAL GOLFER, 15-TIME MAJOR WINNER: It's an honor to be here with you, Mr. President. DOOCY (voice over): White House officials are continuing to play all sides in a race to stop the killing in Ukraine. DOOCY: Who does he think is more responsible for the Russian invasion of Ukraine? Putin or Zelenskyy? REP. MICHAEL WALTZ (R-FL): Well, look, his goal, Peter, is to bring this war to an end. Period. DOOCY (voice over): In Kyiv, Volodymyr Zelenskyy says, ""I had a productive meeting with Special Presidential Envoy Keith Kellogg."" A good discussion many important details. But still resonating in the West Wing, Zelenskyy's assertion that Trump is spreading Russian disinformation. WALTZ: Some of the rhetoric coming out of Kyiv, frankly, an -- insults to President Trump were unacceptable. DOOCY (voice over): A day after President Trump called Zelenskyy a dictator without elections, Boris Johnson, the former British prime minister, says Trump's statements are not intended to be historically accurate, but to shock Europeans into action. French President Macron, who will visit the White House, Monday, seems to agree. EMMANUEL MACRON, PRESIDENT OF FRANCE (through translator): Donald Trump comes in with a new administration, and the Russian president looks at him and doesn't know what he's going to do. This uncertainty is good for us and for Ukraine. DOOCY (voice over): The latest DOGE idea to catch Trump's attention, taxpayer refund checks. TRUMP: I love it. A 20 percent dividend, so to speak, for the money that we're saving, DOOCY (voice over): The checks could be worth up to $5,000, but not all Republicans are sold. REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): We have a $36 trillion federal debt. I think we need to pay down the credit card. DOOCY (voice over): The plan for now, 20 percent to taxpayers, 20 percent to pay down the debt, 60 percent off future spending. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You can either return it to taxpayers, you can return it to our debtors, or it can be cycled into next year's budget. (END VIDEOTAPE) DOOCY (on camera): And so, if these checks wind up getting cut and then sent out to taxpayers, it probably won't be for a while, because they would have to be accounted for in the budget reconciliation process. That is now underway on Capitol Hill, and that typically accounts for spending months or even years from now. Bret. BAIER: Peter Doocy, live in the North Lawn. Peter, thanks. Well, the Senate confirmed Kash Patel today as FBI director. A vote of 51 to 49. Patel seen as one of the more controversial picks at the beginning, is now heading up the bureau. Tonight, the Senate begins voting on a framework for President Trump's budget package, as you just heard, and a Senate legend announces his retirement. Senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram, looks at an action packed today on Capitol Hill. Good evening, Chad. CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Bret, good evening. Vote-a-rama drama. The Senate expecting an all-nighter, a marathon voting session, prepping a blueprint for President Trump's agenda. But some GOP members are baffled why the Senate is charging ahead with its own plan when the president prefers the House bill. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO): This is too important to play a game of chicken with, where, you know, the House says, well, we'll do our own thing. The Senate says we'll do our own thing. PERGRAM (voice over): The Senate bill is lean, focused only on energy and increasing border and military funding. There are risks in the two-step approach. J.D. VANCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Look, it's very rare that you can get two reconciliation bills done in one Congress, which is why he thinks we've got to do a lot with that one big, beautiful bill. PERGRAM (voice over): Budget Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham ignored tax cuts in his bill. He is worried about terrorist attacks from a wide-open border. GRAHAM: If this resolution fails, God help us all. PERGRAM (voice over): Kentucky Republican Rand Paul cautions that this plan is just a framework. SEN. RAND PAUL (R-KY): Ultimately, all the talk of the savings is ephemeral. It isn't real until Congress has the courage to vote on it. PERGRAM (voice over): Democrats doubt Republicans can cut spending without touching entitlements. SEN. RON WYDEN (D-OR): I don't think it's possible to get $880 billion worth of savings the House leadership direction without a significant reduction in Medicaid. PERGRAM (voice over): Another day, another nominee across the finish line. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The yeas are 51. The nays are 49. The confirmation is confirmed. PERGRAM (voice over): All Democrats voted no on the nomination of Kash Patel to be FBI director. He is also a completely sycophantic suck-up. SEN. JOHN THUNE (R-SD): The FBI has lost trust among the American people in recent years, and it's not hard to see why. (END VIDEOTAPE) PERGRAM: Two Republican noes, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Maine, Susan Collins. Patel is only the second Trump nominee to get more than one GOP nay. Bret? BAIER: Chad, a big retirement announcement today. PERGRAM: That's right. The longest serving senate leader in history. Mitch. McConnell will not seek an eighth term next year. McConnell is 83, he remains on the job for now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): Bless any of our colleagues, still doubt my intentions for the remainder of my term. I have some unfinished business to attend to. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERGRAM: Now, among those eyeing a Senate run, Kentucky Representative Andy Barr and former Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron. BAIER: Chad Pergram, live on the Hill. Chad, thank you. A federal judge in Washington is allowing the Trump administration to continue firing federal employees. The Judge declining a request by the National Treasury Employees Union, United Auto Workers, and others to pause the program. The judge saying he did not have the proper jurisdiction over this issue, he encouraged the unions to go before the Federal Labor Relations Authority. A senior U.S. official telling Fox News today, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has a list of top military officers to be fired or removed. Fox News is told the list has a handful of names and it covers multiple services. House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers tells Fox, he has not yet seen this list.

Vance. VANCE: It's very exciting. It's hard to believe we've only been in office for a month. HOFF: Vance highlighted the administration's rapid fire tackling of priorities, cracking down on immigration and government spending. The vice president earned a standing ovation for fiery remarks he made on free speech in Munich last week. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think the really liked it. (CROSSTALK) VANCE: I'm glad you guys liked it. Not everybody liked it. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: OK. HOFF (voice over): Vance also spoke to President Trump's work toward ending the bloodshed in Ukraine. VANCE: He says, everything is on the table, and of course, that makes the heads explode in the American media, because they say, why are you talking to Russia? Well, how are you going to end the war, unless you're talking to Russia? HOFF (voice over): DOGE's Elon Musk took the stage as a surprise addition to CPAC's day-one lineup. ELON MUSK, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, SPACEX, TESLA, AND TWITTER: We just need to restore the fundamental elements of what made America great, which is freedom and opportunity. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, thank God what he is doing. I mean, he is -- he is working his butt off to try to figure out how to make our government work better. HOFF (voice over): Florida Senator Rick Scott was among additional speakers, along with Attorney General Pam Bondi, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and House Speaker Mike Johnson. President Trump will close out the three-day conference with remarks on Saturday. (END VIDEOTAPE) HOFF (on camera): Saturday will be President Trump's 13th time addressing CPAC.

BAIER: Alexander Hoff at CPAC in Maryland. Alex, thanks. A prediction of a sharp decline in earnings for Walmart sent stocks down today. The Dow lost 451. The S&P 500 fell 27. The NASDAQ gave back 94. Overseas now, the bodies of four hostages held by Hamas terrorists were returned to Israel today. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is vowing to, in his words, destroy the murderers and eliminate Hamas. Senior Foreign Affairs correspondent Greg Palkot is in Tel Aviv tonight. GREG PALKOT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice over): It's being called one of the saddest days of this more than 16-month long conflict. The return of four murdered hostages, including a family that captured the hearts of a nation. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's a very sad day for all of us. PALKOT (voice over): It started in Gaza with Hamas making the public, transfer of the remains to the Red Cross. Coffins containing the bodies, then brought to an IDF location for a brief ceremony, transported via convoy as emotional crowds lined the route to Israel's forensic center in Tel Aviv for final examination. Among the remains turned over, those of 32-year-old mother and wife Shiri Bibas and her two sons, 4-year-old Ariel, and 9-month-old Kfir, captured by Hamas and taken to Gaza. Husband and father, Yarden Bibas was also captured, but released alive earlier this month. Hamas claimed without evidence, the three were killed in an Israeli air strike. Israel has denied it. For the nation, the Bibas family's flight seemed to embody all of the hostages suffering. JOSEF LIVNE, RESIDENT TEL AVIV: Two little boys who were taken from their home by savages and we couldn't bring them home alive. PALKOT (voice over): The remains of 83-year-old Oded Lifshitz, also transferred, said to be killed by the Palestinian Jihad group. He was a husband, father, grandfather, great grandfather, and a peace activist, aiding Palestinians in Gaza. His loved one saying in a statement, ""Our family's healing process will begin now and will not end until the last hostage is returned. An angry Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, declaring -- BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, PRIME MINISTER, ISRAEL (through translator): We will return all our hostages. We will destroy the murderers. We will eliminate Hamas and together, with God's help, we will secure our future. PERGRAM: The Bibas family remains are yet to be formally identified. But there is more sadness than hope here tonight, as six more living hostages are set to be released on Saturday. Bret. BAIER: Greg Palkot, live in Tel Aviv. Greg, thank you. A series of explosions on three busses in a parking lot rattling central Israel today, authorities suspect a terror attack. No injuries, fortunately, were reported there. In reaction to all of that, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has instructed the Israeli military to carry out an intense operation, in his words, in the West Bank, against terror hubs. Up next, the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee on Foreign hot spots around the world and his new book on what you can't say about China. First, beyond our borders tonight. Officials at the Vatican say Pope Francis is improving slightly as he battles pneumonia. The 88-year-old pontiff ate breakfast out of bed, worked with his aides at the hospital, some of his cardinals cheered him on and insisted the Catholic Church is very much alive and well, even in his absence. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, appears in two different courts, contesting his arrest on rebellion charges in one, and fighting an effort to remove him from office in the other. Both cases, one on criminal charges, one in impeachment, are related to his brief imposition of martial law in December. And this is a live look at Cape Town, courtesy of EarthCam, one of the big stories there tonight. Foreign ministers from the G20 top economies meet in South Africa. This comes amid differences between members over the Ukraine war and trade disputes. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the Treasury Secretary Bessent, both did not attend. Just some of the other stories, ""BEYOND OUR BORDERS"" tonight. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: A dictator without elections, Zelenskyy better move faster. He's not going to have a country left. MIKE WALTZ, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: For all the administration has done in his first term as well, and all the United States has done for Ukraine is just -- it's unacceptable. They need to tone it down. SEN. JEFF MERKLEY (D-OR): We have a president of the United States who seems to be working to get the best deal for Russia instead of the best deal for Ukraine. (END VIDEO CLIP) BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Well, words are flying between Ukraine and the U.S. Meantime, late this afternoon, Axios, with this, U.S. and Ukraine discuss improved minerals deal after Trump raged at Zelenskyy. A sourced with knowledge said several of Zelenskyy aides have encouraged him to sign an updated proposal to avoid a further clash with Trump and allow the U.S. president to justify further U.S. support for Ukraine. Joining us tonight is Tom Cotton, Republican senator from Arkansas. He's the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference. He's also the author of a new book, Seven Things You Can't Say About China. Senator, good evening. We'll talk about that book in just a second. I want to get your take on what is happening here with what's being said about Ukraine, about the war, and how you see it as head of the Senate Intelligence Committee? SEN. TOM COTTON (R-AR): Yes. Bret, obviously there's been a little sparring between President Trump and President Zelenskyy this week, but I think they'll move beyond that, because they have a shared goal, which is to bring an end to the fighting in Ukraine with a few common objectives. One, is a lasting and durable truce. Two, is to secure, as J.D. Vance said in Europe last week, Ukraine's sovereign independence. And three, is to ensure there's not a third invasion of Ukraine by Russia in the future. The first one happened on Barack Obama's watch. The second one happened on Joe Biden's watch. President Trump, by contrast, was able to prevent any such aggression by Russia in his first term, and it was President Trump that provided the weapons, in fact, that allowed Ukraine to fight off the invasion in February of 2022 and win the battle of Kyiv. Now, we don't know exactly what the contours of that truce will look like. We may have to get creative in some ways, like this proposal to have a minerals deal with Ukraine that would give Ukraine a solid basis for some post war economic growth as they rebuild their country. It would also provide the United States with badly needed diversification for the minerals that we need for our economy that we currently are dependent on China for. So, I think there may be some creative solutions that haven't been on the table yet, but I do know that we want to get to the same place, which is a lasting truce that prevents a third invasion of Ukraine. BAIER: But does the rhetoric hurt? You know, some noted conservatives are pushing back hard against the president. National Review says Ukraine didn't start the war. Ukraine is not the problem. And breathtaking remarks to reporters, President Trump poured contempt on Ukraine for its frustration. Ukraine didn't fire Russian missiles at itself or direct a Russian armed column at its own capital in 2022. There's moral equivalence, and then there's total moral inversion. And then, you've got Mark Levin, who says Zelenskyy is not a dictator. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARK LEVIN, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Ordered martial law. That's what the Constitution there compelled. Zelenskyy hasn't called for an election. That's what the Constitution there compels. Now, I'm waiting for the first free election for Vladimir Putin. I mean, this is almost comical, in a sick way, that Putin is demanding an election. Why is he demanding an election in Ukraine when he doesn't have free and real elections in his own country? (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: So, the go and take is that this rhetoric, no matter if it's negotiating, is empowering Putin in not a good way in their eyes. COTTON: Well, Bret, I don't think the president has empowered Vladimir Putin at all. Again, if you look at what he did in his first term, it objectively was hostile Russia, for instance, he leaned on Germany to stop the gas pipeline. That made Germany so dependent on Russian gas. It caused Germany to kind of be soft on the potential invasion of Ukraine in 2021 and 2022. The President committed more oil and gas production, both in his first term and his second term. That's directly antagonistic towards Russia, since they depend on oil and gas production. And again, the president supported throughout his first term the very weapons that allowed Ukraine to defend itself during the second invasion of Ukraine by Russia. So again, I know there have been some sparks this week, but I suspect we'll move beyond that pretty quickly, because President Trump and President Zelenskyy have the same goal. I think that's the goal of all Americans and Ukrainians, is to bring an end to the fighting, have a lasting truce, protect Ukraine sovereign independence, and prevent a third future invasion of Ukraine. BAIER: All right, your book Seven Things You Can't Say About China. Just out and listen, you are the first person to talk about the possibility of a lab leak from Wuhan. We covered the first story here on SPECIAL REPORT, and we're called conspiracy theorists for doing it. There are things in this book that are real warnings, red flares about what's coming. COTTON: Yes, absolutely, Bret. I wrote this book Seven Things You Can't Say About China, because I want to ring the alarm for normal Americans who have a justly low opinion of Communist China, but they may not understand just how bad it is. Not just that China has been waging an economic world war against America's workers and businesses, or is preparing their military for against the United States, but China has infiltrated our society, our government. You mentioned the coverage that this network had about the Wuhan Coronavirus, likely originating in a laboratory. Fox News is the only network in America that's not owned by or affiliated with a Hollywood movie studio. And all those Hollywood movie studios are dependent upon China giving them access to their large, lucrative movie market. Do you really trust all those other networks to shoot you straight about communist China's crimes? I don't, but that's just an example of the influence that we've allowed Communist China to gain in our society because of our massive economic dependence in China's wealth and power. BAIER: Senator, quickly, do you think we are destined for some kind of confrontation with China? COTTON: No, I don't believe in destiny in that way, everything depends on human choice, individual choice, and our choices collectively. The American people know that Communist China is a threat. They are prepared to do what's necessary to deter that threat, not to win a war against China, but to prevent one from ever happening by having a strong military, by being competent in the assertion of American interest and by standing up to China's crimes against America's workers and businesses. That's the way we make sure the next American -- or the next century, is an American Century, not a Communist Chinese century. BAIER: OK, the book is Seven Things You Can't Say About China. Senator Cotton, thanks for the time. COTTON: Thank you. BAIER: Up next, President Trump pulls the plug on financial aid to illegal immigrants. Plus, hard feelings and even harder checks. Get ready for a hockey border war tonight between U.S. and Canada. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Breaking news we just told you about, updating an earlier story about the return of those four deceased Israeli hostages by Hamas terror groups. Israel is now saying the IDF has discovered that one of the bodies is not of the hostage Shiri Bibas. That was the mother of the children. It was thought she was included with the remains of her two children. The two children's bodies were identified. Israel says the unidentified body does not match that of a known hostage. It is asking Hamas to return Shiri Bibas's body. The two children have been identified, but the mother's identified is not that of the woman who was believed to be killed. Now they are going back to Hamas. That's breaking just in the past few minutes. FOX Weather alert now. Millions of people from the Tennessee valley to the mid-Atlantic remain under winter weather alert tonight after the region continues to clean up after a deadly winter storm that slammed the region. Treacherous travel conditions have been reported on numerous roads and highways, including a deadly crash that occurred in Orange County, North Carolina. President Trump is using the power of the pen to cut off funding for aid to illegal immigrants. Correspondent Griff Jenkins explains tonight. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) SEN. J.D. VANCE, (R) VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Why are we taking the people's Social Security payments and giving it to illegal aliens? We have got to stop it. GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: No more taxpayer funded benefits for illegal migrants, that's the goal of President Trump's executive order directing all federal departments and agencies to identify and end any such programs which Border Czar Tom Homan says incentivizes illegal immigration. TOM HOMAN, WHITE HOUSE BORDER CZAR: It is major driver. Welfare cards and food stamps and social services, and look, you see all around these homes. This has been going on decades. JENKINS: The Congressional Budget Office estimates more than $175 billion worth of federal benefits in the form of Obamacare, Medicaid, tax credits, and food stamps was set to go to illegal migrants and their children over the next 10 years. REP. CHIP ROY, (R-TX): This is something that, frankly, Congress should have been more on top of over the last several years. JENKINS: The order also seeks to cut off any federal funds used to support sanctuary policies in states and local entities, and mandates improvements in welfare eligibility verification. Under the current law signed by President Clinton in 1996, illegal migrants are barred from welfare programs. But under the Biden administration, some migrants became eligible for certain benefits when they were paroled legally into the U.S. That will now end unless a legal challenge prevails, though some legal experts say that's unlikely. PHILIP HOLLOWAY, FORMER COBB COUNTY, GEORGIA, ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY: He is ordering federal agencies to comply with that 1996 law. So this has federal statutory backing. This executive order is on solid, legal grounds. (END VIDEO TAPE) JENKINS (on camera): So far, no lawsuits against this order have been brought. But in a separate legal filing today, a group of Venezuelan migrants sued the Trump administration to reinstate temporary protective status given to them under the Biden administration. Bret? BAIER: Griff, thank you. Also breaking tonight, a federal judge has denied the request by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops to temporarily block the Trump executive order suspending the government's refugee resettlement program. It is a temporary legal loss for the mostly faith-based groups that provide or arrange for services for the newly arrived refugees. Now, there are political overtones to tonight's championship game between the U.S. and Canada in the four nations hockey tournament in Boston. It is a big game. In their first meeting last week in Montreal the U.S. National Anthem was booed by fans there. There were fights early on, insults after the game. President Trump got involved today with a phone call. Correspondent Nate Foy is inside TD Garden in Boston tonight. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) NATE FOY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: President Donald Trump called Team USA before tonight's championship game against Canada. KAROLINE LEAVITT, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: He looks forward to watching the game tonight, and we look forward to the United States beating our soon-to-be 51st state Canada. FOY: Trump again mocked Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, posting on Truth Social, quote, ""We will all be watching. And if Governor Trudeau would like it join us, he would be most welcome. (BOOS) FOY: Moments after Canadian fans booed the U.S. National Anthem on Saturday. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And the gloves are off. FOY: USA star forward Matthew Tkachuk, his brother Brady Tkachuk, and American winger J.T. Miller all fight Canadian players in the first nine seconds of the game. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did not see this coming. FOY: Team Canada forward Brandon Hagel made one of the Americans for planning the fights in a group text. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Maybe our team doesn't like each other, then, if they don't have group texts. FOY: Team Canada head coach Jon Cooper acknowledged the political tension. JON COOPER, TEAM CANADA COACH: I'm a hockey coach. Am I aware of what is going on around the world? I am. FOY: Flashback two weeks ago, Tkachuk visited the White House. MATTHEW TKACHUK, TEAM USA PLAYER: Being one of the few Americans who loves this country so much, this is such an incredible day for myself. FOY: Tonight both Tkachuks and several of their teammates are playing through injuries to represent the United States. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're the luckiest in the world to be Americans and to grow up and live in this country. And now we have a chance to represent it at the biggest stage. It's an opportunity of a lifetime. (END VIDEO TAPE) FOY (on camera): Bret, great moments are born from great opportunity, and that is what we have here tonight. Keep in mind the NHL prevented these players from competing in each of the past two Olympics, so for many of them it's the first time that they can represent their country, at least as professionals. But this will be even better, because in the Olympics you can't fight. Here you can, and I wouldn't be surprised if a few guys have a go out there on the ice tonight, Bret. We'll send it back to you. BAIER: Man, Nate, I am jealous of that assignment. That's a pretty good one. (LAUGHTER) FOY: It might be the best one that I have ever had, Bret. BAIER: There you go. As mentioned at the top of the show, a golf summit today at the White House of sorts. The commissioner of the PGA Tour along with player directors Tiger Woods and Adam Scott attended another meeting aimed at unifying men's professional golf. A statement just moments ago from the PGA Tour suggests progress was being made and they are getting close. The PGA Tour and Saudi Arabia's public investment fund are seeking federal approval of that merger. Up next, The panel on the first month of President Trump's second term. First, here's what some of our FOX affiliates around the country are covering tonight. FOX 31 in Denver with the closing of the Aurora apartment complex infiltrated by that violent Venezuelan gang. The police chief there says units meant to house three to four people were often filled up to 17 people. He says crime is down about 20 percent since his department began its crackdown on that gang. FOX 13 in Seattle as the judge in the Idaho student murders trial denies a defense motion to exclude crucial DNA evidence. Bryan Kohberger is accused of killing four University of Idaho students. Investigators linked Kohberger to the crime scene using material collected on a knife sheath, family tree databases, and DNA collected from trash at his family home. And this is a live look at Tampa from FOX 13, our affiliate there. One of the big stories there tonight, Major League Baseball begins testing a computerized system to call balls and strikes. It'll be used in some spring training games. MLB says the system could be employed to aid umpires but not replace them. It could potentially go online as early as 2026. That's tonight's live look outside the beltway from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: In four weeks our new administration has achieved more than most administrations achieve in four years. KAROLINE LEAVITT, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: There is no denying this administration is off to an historic start. SEN. PETER WELCH, (D-VT): Mr. Trump has enacted executive order after executive order to dismantle our institutions. STEPHEN MILLER, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF: He has packed eight years of transformative action restoring this nation, restoring our laws, restoring fairness, restoring economic opportunity, restoring national security in just one month. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Well, it's one month in. ""Axios"" writes this, ""Trump's Mega-MAGA Month Transforms America. President Trump's first month in office has exceeded the wildest dreams of his most loyal supporters and the darkest nightmares of his fiercest detractors. Above all else, Trump's first month has been dominated by his war on the federal bureaucracy. If his bets pay off, he will have rewritten the rules of American governance for generations. If they backfire, the consequences could be just as historic."" With that, let's bring in our panel, Trey Gowdy, former Congressman from South Carolina, ""USA Today"" White House correspondent Francesca Chambers, and Josh Kraushaar is a FOX News Radio political analyst. Josh, you can't deny that this has been fast and furious, but to listen to Stephen Miller kind of lay it all out there at the White House, what's your take of this 30 days? JOSH KRAUSHAAR, FOX NEWS RADIO POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, it's hard to believe it's only been a month. It feels like it's been a year with all the executive or",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 a lot of disruption across the board with the federal bureaucracy, a lot of chaos and disruption on the foreign policy stage, as we have learned this week. Look, there's some new polls out this week. It looks like Donald Trump still has higher job approval numbers right now than he did almost throughout that first term. But they are a little bit on the decline. And I think the big concern if you're the Trump administration is that there is growing worries about the state of the economy. Inflation is still a nagging worry for a whole lot of the Americans, including a lot of those Republican voters that backed him in hopes that the price of groceries would go down and the price of eggs would go down and so on. So I think the one concern if you're the Trump administration, in addition to, they're breaking a lot of things and hoping it works out for the best. But I think fundamentally, prices are going to need to be stabilized and there's going to need to be a laser focus on making sure people can afford the price of groceries, the price of housing. That is going to be what ultimately decides the success of his first year. BAIER: And it's interesting that, Francesca, there is now talk of about DOGE dividend checks mentioned at the White House today. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEPHEN MILLER, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF: The way that it works is when you achieve savings, you can either return to the taxpayers, you can return it to our debtors, or it can be cycled into next year's budget. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And when is it that people might she those checks? MILLER: It's all going to be worked on through the reconciliation process with Congress that's going on underway right now. As you've seen, the Senate is moving a bill. The House is moving a bill. The president has great confidence in both chambers to deliver on his priorities. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Francesca, what about that? Obviously sending checks to 79 million households could be inflationary in some way. But, obviously, people would welcome those $5,000 checks. FRANCESCA CHAMBERS," """"USA TODAY"""": To this point", Bret, insiders and allies have noted that President Trump has been able to get through his first month using a lot of executive orders to deliver on his campaign promises. But now, the focus turns to Congress to be able to deliver on his agenda, because so much of what he is saying in his executive order, as the administration has acknowledged, has to be funded by Congress, especially when it comes to immigration. And so, it will be up to Congress in those, either the two bills or the one bill, to put money behind those priorities. And just to give you a sense of the timeline for that, you heard J.D. Vance, the vice president say today, and a former senator say, even at the fastest possible pace, it would be May or June before you could realistically get that bill passed. BAIER: And I should point out Speaker Johnson said he'd like that money to go towards paying down the debt or paying for what they're dealing with in the budget as opposed to sending checks right now. Meantime, Trey, your friend who you advocated for, Kash Patel, is now FBI director despite some late pushback from Democrats outside the FBI building today. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. SHELDON WHITEHOUSE, (D-RI) SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: Kash Patel, mark my words, will cause evil in this building behind us, and Republicans who vote for him will rue that day. REP. ADAM SCHIFF, (D-CA): This is someone we cannot trust. This is someone who lacks the character to do this job, someone who lacks the integrity to do this job. SEN. JOHN CORNYN, (R-TX): My Democratic colleagues want to act like November the 5th never happened. But actually, the election was a repudiation of the Biden administration, including its Department of Justice and FBI. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: There were only five senators there," not a big crowd. But Patel posted what his mission is. """"My mission as director is clear. Let good cops be cops", rebuild trust in the FBI, work alongside the dedicated men and women of the Bureau and our partners. We will rebuild an FBI the American people can be proud of. And to those who seek to harm Americans," consider this your warning. We will hunt you down in every corner of this planet."""" It was one of the most controversial picks", but in the end 51-49. TREY GOWDY, FORMER SOUTH CAROLINA REPRESENTATIVE: Yes, Bret. It's just not controversial among us, those of us who worked with him. The notion of Adam Schiff talking about fairness and impartiality and respect for the rule of law, it's just honestly a little more than I can handle. Kash Patel will be more fair to his critics than they ever were to him. He's a former prosecutor, former public defender. Look, give the guy a chance. I worked elbow to elbow with him. Give the guy a chance. He will exceed your expectations. And I will tell you this, Bret. He will be a lot more fair to Adam Schiff than Adam ever was to him. BAIER: All right, panel, stand by, if you would. Up next, comments from President Trump and Vice President Vance about Ukraine's leadership. And then a thrilling rescue after a dangerous avalanche. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. J.D. VANCE, (R) VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Wherever war breaks out, he's going to be the president of peace. DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: A dictator without a elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he's not going to have a country left. Got to move. SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, (D-CT): Utterly despicable. A disgusting betrayal of a country that has bled and fought. SEN. ERIC SCHMITT, (R-MO) SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE: We keep sending tens of billions of dollars over there. No one has even defined what victory looks like. BAIER: Are you optimistic that there is going to be an end game here, that the negotiation works? SCOTT BESSENT, TREASURY SECRETARY: The plan that I have seen that President Trump has, I think he could win the Nobel Peace Prize for this. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: A lot different takes about what's being said right now, but as far as what is being done in the negotiations, still in the early stages. However, as I mentioned with Senator Cotton earlier, there are conservatives who are concerned about the president's words when it comes to Vladimir Putin specifically. Here's the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. ROGER WICKER, (R-MS), CHAIRMAN, SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE: Putin is a war criminal and should be in jail for the rest of his life, if not executed. Vladimir Putin has violated every tenet of international law. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: And we're back with our panel. Trey, what do you make of this? We're getting late word that China is signing onto the negotiations, saying the U.S.-Russia framework is something they can buy into. GOWDY: The same China that's been helping Russia kill Ukrainians for the last couple years? I mean, Putin has more in common with Hamas than he does American ideals. So we've got to stop blaming the victim. I don't like doing it in criminal cases. I don't like doing it in invasions. I hope Tom Cotton is right, Bret. You just had him on. I hope he's right that this is just sparring, and that we remember that Vladimir Putin is a war criminal who takes Americans hostage, for the love of Jesus. He takes Americans hostage and then trades them back. So, no, that -- you can sign me up for Ukraine and not Russia on that one. BAIER: Yes. Francesca, what's the feeling at the White House on this? I mean, obviously, the president's tone has changed and Vice President Vance has been explaining why that's changed based on what Zelenskyy has said. What's the take at the White House? CHAMBERS: National Security Adviser Michael Waltz said today that the president is very frustrated with President Zelenskyy, and that's very clear if you've heard anything that President Trump has said over the last few days. Since then, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, has appeared to try and take the temperature down a little bit with Trump. Since this program has started tonight, he was tweeting again, or posting on X again tonight about his meeting with General Kellogg in Ukraine today. He talked about security guarantees in order to make a deal. Now, that is a big question right now, is what would those security guarantees even look like? The U.K. has suggested putting peace keeping troops on the ground. Europe hasn't been able to agree to that. We now see that President Macron of France will be at the White House on Monday as well as Keir Starmer later in the week. BAIER: Yes, that's a big deal. Macron coming Monday, the U.K. prime minister coming Thursday. Europe is trying to get a sense of where this is all headed. You mentioned Keith Kellogg, General Keith Kellogg, the Ukraine-Russia adviser, envoy, meeting with Zelenskyy today. They said they had a good meeting. They did not have a press availability after that meeting, Josh. But there's a sense that things are moving, and perhaps, at least according to some of the reporting, that maybe Zelenskyy is getting closer to signing this rare earth deal that the U.S. wants to sign. KRAUSHAAR: Yes, I mean, there are a lot of Senate Republicans, House Republicans, too, that are scratching their heads over Trump attacking our ally, Zelenskyy, and seemingly much more sympathetic to the Russian position this week. and I thought there was a moment at the White House briefing with National Security Adviser Mike Waltz who has always been a Ukraine hawk during his time in Congress. And Peter Doocy asked him whether -- who is more responsible for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. And he couldn't give an answer. There's a lot of worry of not just in Europe but among a lot of traditional national security minded Republicans in Congress. And hopefully, the Kellogg meeting with Zelenskyy led to some good diplomacy because, otherwise, a lot of worried folks on the national security side after this week. BAIER: We'll follow it all and see what actually happens. Panel, thanks. Finally tonight, a SPECIAL REPORT salute. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Approximately two feet down under the snow. We've just uncovered him. He is breathing, conscious, and is speaking to us. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Check that out. Snowmobile rider in Colorado buried in the snow for more than an hour following an avalanche. Rescuers found the rider because of an orange avalanche airbag sticking out of snow. Note to self, bring one of those. They were able to dig him out. He escaped with only minor injuries. Our salute to them for digging him out of that hole. Tomorrow on SPECIAL REPORT," our """"Common Ground"""" segment on efforts to give Congressional Gold Medals to members of the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team", took down the Soviets.

"Interview with Michael Waltz, National Security Adviser",2025-01-30T00:00:00Z,"Lawrence Jones, Steve Doocy, Ainsley Earhardt, Brian Kilmeade","FOX AND FRIENDS 6:00 AM EST Michael Waltz Fox News, FOX AND FRIENDS6:00 AM EST, NEWS; International, 1184words",U.S. Federal; Dist. of Columbia; International,"LAWRENCE JONES, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: National Security Advisor and U.S. Army veteran Michael Waltz joins us now. Michael, it's good to see you, brother. Unfortunately, it's under these circumstances. Your top line thoughts on this crash? I know as a door kicker, you have been in many of these aircrafts before. How does something like this happen? MICHAEL WALTZ, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: Yeah, thanks, Lawrence. Look, this is a terrible tragedy. I know I can speak for the president and that our -- our heart is broken. But at this point, we are all hands on deck. And I can tell you that he was updated throughout the night. As you know, Secretary Duffy was on the scene. NTSB was on the scene. We spoke with Mayor Bowser. I spoke with Governor Youngkin,. This is, again, all hands on deck from the Park Service to the Coast Guard to local both state and local responders, the airport recovery services. And I've also spoken with the military. To answer your question, Lawrence, this was a routine training flight. As you know, a Black Hawk typically has two pilots. In this case, it was and I can tell you it was an officer and a warrant officer, they tend to have a lot of experience. And then you have an enlisted crew chief in the back. So we'll let the investigation unfold as to what happened. But, you know, our hearts go out to the families, American Airlines, and their CEO has also been in touch for all of those notifications. And then, you know, finally, God bless those Coast Guardsmen and those rescuers, those park police that are down in those frigid waters, you know, making sure that we don't have -- they're doing everything they can to make sure we don't have a fuel spillage. And they've recovered -- they've recovered now over 30 bodies. STEVE DOOCY, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Yeah. And Michael, what adds to the calculus regarding trying to figure out what happened? You know, this airplane, this American Eagle -- Airlines Eagle flight from Wichita was coming in over the water, which at night it's dark. You don't really see how far up you are. You can see the lights in the distance. And it looks like the chopper just came in from the side. There, I don't imagine there is any spot on Earth that is going to have so many records of what went on in the sky before that, because everything is being tracked. Given the fact that you're at the White House and they've got all sorts of sensors to see if anything's flying at the White House. And it's the same thing down there by where the crash occurred. It's close to the Pentagon. So many sensitive sites, so much. Is it going to be a gigantic digital trail? WALTZ: I think there will be, although pulling all of that together may take a little bit of time because it is various agencies that are involved. But, you know, Brian, one of the questions -- excuse me, Steve, one of the questions that I have is, you know, where are the pilots under night vision? Were they not? Those are things that -- that the investigators will have to, you know, will have to determine. And, you know, at this point, we are on monitoring. We are making sure everyone has the resources. I sent one of my senior staff from the National Security Council to the D.C. Emergency Operations Center to make sure those local, state and federal resources are all integrated and are coordinating and doing the best we can to recover this site. About 4 a.m. this morning, unfortunately, we transitioned from response to recovery. AINSLEY EARHARDT, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Oh, wow. Does that mean everyone? Everyone involved? WALTZ: That's what it's looking like -- that's what it's looking like at this point. EARHARDT: Do you know how long it will take to find out what happened? I know they've recovered one of the black boxes, at least. That's what Lucas was saying. He's there on the ground. How long would it take? WALTZ: Yeah. I don't have a direct, you know, or definitive timeline at this point. Again, Secretary Duffy is on the ground. NTSB got on the ground very quickly. And they will unpack all of this from the digital footprint, the radar track, what we know from GPS movements, exactly what the Black Hawk pilots were saying, doing and seeing and their flight trajectory. Obviously, there's a huge piece here with the air traffic controller and what they saw in those last moments and the instructions that they gave. So we'll pull all of those together from those various agencies. Part of our job here is to coordinate all of that and then to keep both the president, the vice president, and all of the senior folks in the administration informed. BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Just so people know what the Black Hawk looks like. It's got four blades, twin engines, medium lift utility, military helicopter. It's a modified version developed for the U.S. Navy, Air Force and Coast Guard. It carries 15 people, including two pilots, two crew chiefs and two rescue specialists. Three U.S. Army soldiers were on board during the crash. Now, right away, Michael, people are looking at this and saying, Sean Duffy had the job for a couple of hours. Now he's on the scene with a windbreaker on and he's got to assess it. And then you have an OMB director who can't even get a vote, who would have certainly helped with that executive order two days ago. And wouldn't it be great to have a DNI in place ahead of time? You just now got a secretary of defense. He, 48 hours, on the job is offering out -- offering out statements and procedures. There's got to be more of an urgency in the Senate to get your people confirmed. How do you do that? WALTZ: Yep, Brian, you know, so many people are brand new in the job, but they also bring so much experience to these jobs. And as you saw last night, nobody is sitting back. We're leaning forward in the saddle and getting right there on the scene, showing leadership, showing determination to get to the bottom of what happened. But to your point, yes, the President needs all of his cabinet officials. He needs all his players on the field. I can tell you from my perspective with what's going on in the Middle East, the wars we're going to stop in Ukraine, Russia, the movement on the southern border and taken on the cartels. I need a Director of National Intelligence like yesterday. And -- but we're going to get them through. We're looking forward to seeing Kash Patel as the next Director of the FBI. Tulsi Gabbard is the next Director of National Intelligence. I will be out at the CIA today with new Director Ratcliffe. But as a former DNI, yes, a few days on the job, but years and decades of experience that we're bringing to it. We're hitting the ground running. And the President has -- is all gas, no brakes right now. KILMEADE: Yeah. So we've noticed -- JONES: So Michael, you don't think that these hearings are going to be -- because of the, you know, the tragedy that just took place. You don't think they're going to be delayed as a result of that? DOOCY: Let me interrupt. JONES: I'm sorry about that. DOOCY: Here's the mayor of Washington, D.C., Muriel Bowser, is about to have a press conference. KILMEADE: Thanks, Michael.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NOEM: Well, before he left town, Mayorkas signed an order that said for 18 months, they were going to extend this protection to people that are in temporary protected status, which meant they were going to be able to stay here and violate our laws for another months and we stopped that. Today, we signed an executive order within the department of homeland security in a direction that we were not going to follow through on what he did to tie our hands, that we are going to follow the process, evaluate all of these individuals that are in our country, including the Venezuelans that are here and members of TDA. Listen, I was in New York City yesterday, and the people of this country want these dirt bags out. They want their communities to be safe. It was so amazing to me to see people walk by us on the street early in the morning and just say ""thank you"", ""thank you for being here"". So this is part of our plan to make sure that we're protecting America, keeping it safe again just like President Trump promised. (CROSSTALK) JONES: Go ahead, Ainsley. AINSLEY EARHARDT, FOX NEWS HOST: Thank you, Lawrence. There's some Democratic leaders that are pushing back against these ICE raids, I don't get it. But here's -- here's some of the comments from these Democratic leaders. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRANDON JOHNSON (D), CHICAGO MAYOR: Stand together firmly in our welcoming city status. The type of fear that this administration is trying to incite, we are demonstrating that we are going to protect the residents of this city. LETITIA JAMES (D), NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL: It is performative theater and it -- it's nothing more than shock and awe. GOV. JB PRITZKER (D), ILLINOIS: Our local law enforcement will stand up for those law-abiding undocumented people in our states. (END VIDEO CLIP) EARHARDT: The message that I'm hearing from them -- BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS HOST: Law-abiding. EARHARDT: I know -- the message I'm hearing from them is we want to protect the rapist that's here illegally. We want to protect that person that was arrested over the last few days that has ties to ISIS. We want to protect the man who allegedly murdered his girlfriend who was pregnant and a mother of two. What are -- what is your -- why are they -- why do they have a problem with arresting these career criminals that are here illegally? NOEM: They're completely out of touch with the people in their cities and communities. That's exactly what these Democrat leaders are saying is we want to protect the cartels. We want to protect the gangs. We want to make sure that people continue to die from guns violence and drugs. And it's wrong and they're going to find out very soon that their communities are not with them. And listen, yesterday, we picked up one of the ring leaders of TDA. He had just been a part of a gun weapons exchange and was trying to buy grenades. Why would anybody in this country need to buy a grenade and go out and perpetuate violence? He was one of those that was involved in Colorado, in Aurora, and we're so thankful we got him off the streets. And what I've continuously said to people is, you know, what do you say to Laken Riley's family? We're going to sign that bill today into law, the president will in the Oval Office, to make sure we're going after these criminals. But the president's taking action and what was amazing is you'll hear people and Democrat leaders in different cities like New York City, some of their city council members have tried to attack what we're doing as far as enforcing our laws. But the people on the streets are not with them. It was amazing to hear people and see them as they walked by taking their kids to school, going to work, just walk by us and quietly say ""thank you,"" ""thank you for being here"". JONES: And so -- NOEM: And that means the world to those officers that are out there risking their lives to bring safety back. JONES: So, Madam Secretary, you guys -- your men and women are doing a fantastic job. It's a dangerous job. Those fugitive task force, it's -- it's a risky business. It's easy in a sense from a PR perspective to get the criminals. No one wants, unless you're deranged, want the criminals on the street, the violent criminals. What I worry about is the PR when you guys go to the next layer of people that have overstayed their visas or work -- doing other jobs. How do you guys overcome that? Because we -- you've been in politics for a long time. The American people can be fickle. They support something at one point, and then the news media puts a crying child or someone on TV, and they change. So how are y'all going to handle that portion? NOEM: I think we keep talking to people and talk to them about the fact that this is an America where justice is applied equally. You know, we can't say that American citizens have to follow the law and then say that people from this other countries don't have to. You know, we choose laws, we put them in place. Congress has the chance to change the law. But until then, our job is to enforce it. And when you want to live in a country where everybody's treated the same and fairly and equally and has a chance to live the American dream. So we understand that there's some families who have been here illegally and have been perpetuating that, that's a discussion that we're going to have to continue to have and see if we can fix our legal immigration system as well. That's one of my jobs is, you know, not only are we going after those that are here illegally, but we have to do due diligence and making sure we have the resources to process paperwork in a timely manner. And so, more immigration courts and judges, getting those kind of resources through Congress is important to make sure we're not just securing the border, we're deporting these dangerous individuals and then fixing our broken system. KILMEADE: And also legal work visas for the construction industry -- NOEM: Yes. KILMEADE: -- and other things like that, because there's people with great work ethics. Real quick, what are you going to do with the Venezuelans, the Cubans, when they don't -- these countries don't want to take them back. You got 607,000 Venezuelans here, what do we do? NOEM: Well, we have a fantastic secretary state in Secretary Rubio and he has been doing incredible work. You know, the other night, I was talking to him on the phone at 1:00 in the morning and he was up and still discussing negotiations with other countries and working with his people and in these countries to do diplomatic relations. And the president clearly will exercise all the authority and power that he has to make these countries take him back. So -- KILMEADE: Are you ruling out Gitmo? NOEM: Oh, yeah, we're -- we're evaluating and talking about that right now. So, president's decision but it's an asset and we're going to continue to look at how we can use all of our assets to keep America safe. DOOCY: What a whirlwind it must have been for you over the last week or so. Kristi Noem, secretary of homeland security, thank you very much. JONES: Congratulations, by the way. NOEM: Thank you. EARHARDT: Congratulations. NOEM: We're glad to get work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And coming up on SPECIAL REPORT, a high stakes face off in federal court over deportation flights for alleged gang members from Venezuela. Plus, out with the old and in with the new, Democrats searching for a new identity. The Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer faces heat from within his own party. And then, stick to your guns. The judge is facing scrutiny and praise over his viral firearm dissent. But first, breaking tonight, President Trump says he has secured a $5.8 billion investment from Hyundai at for a Louisiana steel manufacturing plant as part of a four year $21 billion deal. The announcement is among a number of recent big dollar investments from companies that the president attributes to the threat of tariffs on imported goods. President Trump widened his tactics today with a 25 percent secondary tariff on any country that buys oil or gas from Venezuela. Stock soared on tariff optimism. The Dow surged 598, the S&P 500 jumped 100, NASDAQ gained 405. And by the way, Tesla stock was up almost 30 percent -- up almost $30.00 today. Let's start there with senior White House Correspondent Jacqui Heinrich, she's live on the North Lawn. Good evening, Jacqui, busy day there. JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening. Good evening, John. The president previously insisted that he would equalize tariff rates on all countries on April 2nd, and there was nothing that any country could do to get out of that. But it appeared to shift at least a little bit today. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Get ready. This investment is a clear demonstration that tariffs very strongly work. HEINRICH (voice over): President Trump announcing a $5.8 billion investment from Hyundai for a new Louisiana steel plant expected to produce 1,400 jobs and millions of metric tons of raw material. TRUMP: This will be Hyundai's first ever steel mill in the United States. As a result, they'll not have to pay any tariffs. You know, there are no tariffs if you make your product in America. HEINRICH (voice over): But it was this remark about reciprocal tariffs on all countries coming April 2nd that rallied the stock market. TRUMP: Well, I may give a lot of countries breaks, but it's reciprocal, but we might be even nicer than that. In other words, they've charged us so much that I'm embarrassed to charge them what they've charged us. HEINRICH (voice over): Investors Monday buoyed by hope the president's tariff stance is softening. But in the same breath, he also touted new pressure on Venezuela and its biggest oil customers. TRUMP: If they buy their oil from Venezuela, they have to pay a 25 percent tariff to do business with the United States. That's on top of existing tariffs. Yes. HEINRICH (voice over): In his cabinet meeting, the president said reciprocal tariffs have already driven trade negotiations and new business. TRUMP: We have probably identified maybe $4 trillion worth of companies moving back or going to move back. HEINRICH (voice over): Plus, a minerals deal with Ukraine near completion. TRUMP: They'll sign it shortly. HEINRICH (voice over): Secretary of State Marco Rubio, sending a signal in his update on talks with Russia and Ukraine to implement the partial cease fire. MARCO RUBIO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: There is no military solution to this war. It has to enter negotiation. HEINRICH (voice over): General Jack Keane translating. GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST: I know from talking to our own security senior officials that they know full well Zelenskyy has already agreed to a cease fire, but Putin, I think the jury is still out. That's in the mind of some of our senior officials who are dealing with the Russians. (END VIDEOTAPE) HEINRICH (on camera): In an interview with Time Magazine, Zelenskyy raised concern with some of the concessions President Trump has agreed to, including taking NATO membership off the table and inviting Russia back into the G7. But overall, he expressed confidence in the Trump team's ability, John. ROBERTS: Jacqui, in another matter, it appears that there was a major national security blunder when the editor in chief of The Atlantic magazine was inadvertently included on a classified text chain regarding the recent strikes against the Houthis in Yemen, what is the White House saying about that? HEINRICH: Well, John, the National Security Council says the texts appear authentic. And right now, there's investigation into how the editor in chief of the Atlantic was inadvertently added to this chain, which included the Vice President, the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, National Security Adviser and the Director of National Intelligence. At one point, Vice President Vance advocated for delaying the strikes by a month, saying that Europe needs the shipping lanes reopened more than the U.S. But after some debate, it certainly moved forward. Asked about this today, the president seemed unaware of this story, but the press secretary later said that the president continues to have confidence in his national security team, including National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, who apparently accidentally invited this reporter into the chain, John. ROBERTS: An oops of the highest magnitude. Jacqui Heinrich live for us at 1600 Pennsylvania. Thank you, Jacqui. Three federal judges are meeting privately and mulling their next move after hearing emergency oral arguments on the deportation of suspected Venezuelan gang members. Correspondent David Spunt heard the arguments first hand. He joins us now from the U.S. district court here in Washington. Good evening, David. DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: John, good evening to you. This is a classic legal and political fight over the president's unilateral power. At issue, did a federal district judge here in Washington overstep his authority when he ordered two planes full of more than 250 suspected gang members to be turned back around to the United States, despite the fact those flights had already left U.S. airspace and were bound for a prison in El Salvador. Those people right now in El Salvador in prison and the United States is answering questions about those. The three judge panel had tough questions on both sides, Judge Millett, an Obama appointee saying Trump's use here with the Alien Enemies Act, a typical wartime authority was, ""unprecedented, and did not give the suspected gang members a due process right to contest their impending deportation before a judge."" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PATRICIA MILLETT, JUDGE: If the government says there's we don't have to give process for that, then you all could hook me up on Saturday and throw me on a plane thinking I'm a member of Tren de Aragua and giving me no chance to protest it. There were plane loads of people. There were no procedures in place to notify people. Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemy Act that has happened here. (END VIDEO CLIP) SPUNT: But John, the DOJ lawyer, disputed the Nazi analogy and said to District Judge James Boasberg ordered to return the deportees midflight was a, ""Enormous intrusion upon the powers of the executive branch."" An ACLU attorney representing the migrants was pressed by Judge Walker, a Trump appointee, on whether courts in the past have tried to interfere in what he termed an ongoing national security operation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JUSTIN WALKER, U.S. CIRCUIT JUDGE: Can you just tell me what's an example of a district court enjoining a national security operation with foreign relations implications? I think we can at least agree on that. (END VIDEO CLIP) SPUNT: It almost seemed like a rhetorical question the attorney could not answer. Meanwhile, Judge Karen Henderson, a George H. W. Bush appointee from the early 1990s did not speak today, and she could really tip the scales here and tell us how we're going to find out what will happen with this case. The losing side here, no doubt, will likely take this to the Supreme Court, John. ROBERTS: And David, on the subject of the Supreme Court, what can you tell us about another move by the Trump administration to appeal to the justices? SPUNT: Well, the Trump administration went to the Supreme Court earlier today. There was a federal judge in San Francisco that ruled that 16,000 federal employees almost immediately should be rehired. This is part of DOGE's efforts to cut government and the following agencies, the Department of Defense, Agriculture, Energy, Interior, Treasury and Veterans Affairs Departments, they're all affected, and we could hear something from the Supreme Court as soon as this week, John. ROBERTS: All right, we'll look forward to that in the latest news. David, thank you. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement says its agents and partners have apprehended 370 illegal aliens in Massachusetts. Those arrests came during an enhanced targeted enforcement operation focusing on transnational organized crime and gangs. White House Borders Czar Tom Homan was in Boston to oversee the six day long operation. The FBI is launching a task force with the goal of catching those involved in setting fire to Tesla vehicles and Tesla charging stations across the country. The 10 person panel will deploy personnel from the ATF and the FBI's counterterrorism division. The announcement comes amid widespread acts of violence targeting the electric car maker, including today as incendiary devices were discovered at a Tesla dealership in Austin, Texas. A bomb squad was called in to investigate, and the devices were taken safely into police custody. An investigation into that is open and ongoing. Congressional Republicans are searching for ways to counter federal judges who the GOP believe are exceeding their authority by limiting Trump administration policies. Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram has that story from Capitol Hill. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Reining in federal judges who Republicans believe went too far. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: These are activist judges not following the law. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What we're trying to do is take legislative action. PERGRAM (voice over): President Trump demanding that judges who don't rule his way, ""Should be impeached."" Arch conservatives targeting impeachment for Judge James Boasberg and three other judges for their rulings against the administration. PERGRAM: Is impeachment too much? REP. MIKE EZELL (R-MS): No, I don't think it is. When a judge could stop the executive from doing what he has duly been sworn to do. I think that that's going too far. PERGRAM (voice over): Republicans accuse judges of exceeding their authority with nationwide decisions. Chief Justice John Roberts saying, ""Impeachment is not an appropriate response to a judge's ruling."" But others disagree. REP. KAT CAMMACK (R-FL): We have an absolute right to step in and, of course, impeach these activist judges. REP. DARRELL ISSA (R-CA): Impeachment is a very dull tool. PERGRAM (voice over): Issa authored a bill to limit the country wide scope of these rulings. ISSA: It's not the decision they made, it's the breadth of making it a national decision. PERGRAM (voice over): House Speaker Mike Johnson supports alternatives to impeachment and House hearings. REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): I suspect that we may wind up questioning some of these judges themselves to have them defend their actions. PERGRAM (voice over): Democrats stand by the judge's controversial rulings. REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): They're doing their job. That's why they're talking about impeaching all these federal judges. (END VIDEOTAPE) PERGRAM (on camera): House Majority Leader Steve Scalise says members will vote on ISIS bill to restrict the overreach of judges next week, and it's doubtful the House has the votes to impeach anyone. It takes two thirds to convict in the Senate, John. ROBERTS: Chad Pergram live for us on Capitol Hill, as always, Chad, thank you. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is remaining defiant against his Democratic colleagues amid calls to step aside as leader over his decision to support the Republican bill to fund the government. Some Democrats are seeking younger and tougher leadership. Senior National Correspondent Aishah Hasnie shows us from Capitol Hill. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) AISHAH HASNIE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Tonight, Democrats are unloading on Republicans. REP. JASMINE CROCKETT (D-TX): It's Ted Cruz. I mean, like this suit has to be knocked over the head. HASNIE (voice over): And each other. KAT ABUGHAZALEH, INFLUENCER: So, I say it's time to drop the excuses and grow (EXPLETIVE DELETED). HASNIE (voice over): Today, far left influencer Kat Abughazaleh announced she will primary long time liberal Illinois Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky, progressives are loudly trying to fill a void, but it's unclear if the party will follow. A recent Gallup poll shows 45 percent of Democrats want their party to become more moderate. Well, just 29 percent wanted to become more liberal. But that poll was released before Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer caved to Republicans on a government funding bill, and before Democrats got an earful from angry voters at town halls. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm happy to answer a question, if you have one. HASNIE (voice over): One House Democrat tells Axios a colleague called after an event crying and said they hate us, who they don't hate. REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): Are we ready to win? HASNIE (voice over): Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez embraced by thousands at rallies all over the country. OCASIO-CORTEZ: I don't want to live like this anymore, and we deserve better than this. HASNIE (voice over): And that could set up a potential run in 2028 or the biggest primary challenge in '26. REP. RO KHANNA (D-CA): All I could say is there's real anger, and there would be a lot of support for if she decided to do it. OCASIO-CORTEZ: As some call Chuck Schumer's leadership to question. KRISTEN WELKER, NBC NEWS ANCHOR: Are you making the same mistake that President Biden did? SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): No, absolutely not. (END VIDEOTAPE) HASNIE (on camera): And John, Schumer will have to explain why to his senate colleagues now in person, face to face, tough conversations, as they have all just now returned to Capitol Hill. John. ROBERTS: He is feeling the heat, no doubt about that. Aishah Hasnie live for us. Aishah, thank you. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy is resigning from his position after five years. His departure comes week after he struck an agreement to allow DOGE to help the agency cut costs and remove bureaucratic red tape, to join aim Deputy Postmaster General Doug Tulino to take over until the board names a permanent replacement. As the United States pushes for a peace deal in Ukraine, concerns are growing over Vladimir Putin's motivation to come to the table. Brit Hume has analysis coming up next. First, here's some of what our Fox affiliates across the country are covering tonight. Fox 31 in Denver, where a portrait of President Donald Trump, hanging at the Colorado State Capitol, will be taken down after the president complained it was purposefully distorted. Colorado House Democrats say the oil painting would be taken down at the request of Republican leaders in the legislature. And this is a live look at Port Canaveral, Florida from Fox 35, one of the big stories there tonight, SpaceX blasts off its Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral Space Station, carrying out the NROL-69 mission. The mission is for the National Reconnaissance Office. New details have been released on the expedition because it's classified. That's tonight's live look outside the Beltway from SPECIAL REPORT. We will be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ROBERTS: The Gaza health ministry says Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip killed more than 65 Palestinians over the past day, including women and children. The attacks come as Egyptian officials introduced a new proposal to try to get a cease fire back on track. In the new proposal, Hamas would release five living hostages, including an American Israeli, in return for Israel allowing humanitarian aid into Gaza, and a weeks-long pause in the fighting. Israel would also release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: On a human basis, we want to get it stopped. MARCO RUBIO, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: There is no military solution to this war. It has to enter negotiation, and there's only one leader in the world that's capable of bringing the two sides to a table, and that's our president. GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST: I think the jury is still out on whether Putin is really serious about going to a full cease fire and eventually a peace agreement. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: The U.S. and Russian officials held the second round of talks in Saudi Arabia today, looking to end the war in Ukraine. But there are questions tonight about Vladimir Putin's ambitions and motivations. On another issue, how in the world did the White House invite a journalist into a high-level chat group, discussing classified plans to attack the Houthis? Let's bring in Fox News chief political analyst Brit Hume. So, first of all, let's go in on the Russia-Ukraine deal here. And here is what The New York Times says about Vladimir Putin. ""The Kremlin appears determined to squeeze as many benefits as possible for Mr. Trump's desire for a Ukraine peace deal, even as it slow-walks the negotiations. Viewed from Moscow, better ties with Washington are an economic geopolitical boon -- one that may be achieved even as Russian missiles continue pounding Ukraine."" Vladimir Putin, it seems, Brit, would like to have a new relationship with President Trump, one that may be even more important to him than getting territory in Ukraine. BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, that would be a great help if that were the case, and it may be. But I think, John, what's clear here is that the president has a great deal more leverage with Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Ukraine than he does over President Putin. After all, of course, you know, Ukraine has been heavily dependent on the United States for weapons and money to keep its war effort going, and that situation doesn't apply, obviously, in Russia and the president you'll recall, proposed a 30-day ceasefire to get talks started. Zelenskyy balk famously in the White House, as we all remember, and for his pain, he was thrown out of the Oval Office and kicked out of the White House, and a couple of days later, he agreed to the ceasefire -- to a 30- day ceasefire -- full cease fire. Vladimir Putin has yet to agree to any such a thing. He agreed to a partial cease fire, and the administration seems to be trying to jolly them along as best they can. And I'm sure the worry in Ukraine is that what will be -- what could be the outcome here is a deal that greatly favors Russia and leaving it possibly in a position to further advance, and Ukraine in a weaker position, and a signal that would send, of course, to places like Beijing, is something to worry about, it seems to me. ROBERTS: Yes. I want to also ask you about this story that exploded here in Washington D.C., about high-level White House officials, including the national security adviser, the defense secretary, the secretary of state, and others being on a Signal text chain that just happened to inadvertently include the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine, and what they were talking about was the coming strikes against the Houthis back on the 15th of March. Here is what Chuck Schumer said about all of that. Listen here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): it's bad enough that a private citizen was added to this chain, but it's far worse that sensitive military information was exchanged on an unauthorized application. If these detailed exchanges about coordinating military operations fell into the hands of America's enemies, it could get people killed. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: Well, I think Schumer is probably happy to be talking about anything other than himself, at this point. But this was a big misfire. HUME: That's for sure. And this, of course, is, you know, details of war plans. This is what we're talking about here, about a military operation, or about as sensitive as things get. So, this was -- this was -- this was, you know, a major leak. Fortunately, it was linked to an American citizen. And while he might be considered an enemy of the administration in some quarters, he is certainly not an enemy of the United States. And he did not disclose anything very sensitive, fortunately. I guess what happened is that this this writer, Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic, was in the contacts file of Mike Waltz, who inadvertently included him on an e-mail chain and from the Signal application, and out the thing went. There will be investigations about this. I think it's going to be -- going to be going on going forward. Don't you think, John. ROBERTS: Yes, the president said he didn't know anything about it earlier today. I'm sure he knows a lot more by now. Brit, always great to catch up with you. Thank you. HUME: Yes. Thanks, John. ROBERTS: All right. Coming up next, students at Columbia University returned from spring break, calling for a classroom boycott over the school caving to Trump demands. We will take you there live. Plus, that's one way to get your point across, why some are up in arms over a judge's viral dissent? (COMMERCIAL BREAK) JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS HOST: Students and professors at Columbia University are in a tizzy over their school's compliance with White House demands over federal funding to the university. Students and faculty returned from spring break calling for a classroom boycott. Correspondent Alexis McAdams is on campus tonight with the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALEXIS MCADAMS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Columbia University students and staff rebel against sweeping new policy changes. PROTESTER: Should Donald Trump and Linda McMahon get to command universities to arrest and expel students? PROTESTERS: No. MCADAMS: Protesters angry after the university caved to the Trump administration to try and get back 400 million dollars in federal funding. That was cut after the administration cracked down on what it calls illegal protests. Now this is just the first step. DANA BASH, CNN HOST: Does that mean that the money will be unfrozen? LINDA MCMAHON, U.S. EDUCATION SECRETARY: That means that we are on the right track now to make sure the final negotiations to unfreeze that money will be in place. MCADAMS: Columbia now banning masks used to conceal identity and putting the Department of Middle East, South Asian and African Studies as well as the Center for Palestine Studies under new supervision. The changes come after the arrest of Columbia graduate Mahmoud Khalil, the 30-year-old campus activist who's originally from Syria and has a green card facing deportation as authorities say he's a national security threat. Now the Justice Department says Khalil hid his ties to UNRWA on his green card application. The agency at the center of controversy as Israel says 12 UNRWA employees were involved in Hamas's October 7th terror attack. UNRWA disputes those claims. The DOJ also says Khalil didn't mention that he was working at the Syria office in the British Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon when he applied for a visa. Officials say this could have impacted his visa status. (END VIDEOTAPE) MCMAHON: So we talk all the time, John, about how the Trump administration cut 400 million dollars in federal funding to Columbia. Now we're learning tonight that there could be some significance behind that specific number. About 25 years ago here in New York City Columbia was looking to expand here on the Upper West Side and they looked at some property that was owned by now President Trump. He asked for 400 million dollars for the property. Columbia said no and that's exactly what he took from them when he froze that funding, John. ROBERTS: Well, on another matter a Columbia student is suing the Trump administration after she says immigration officials tried to arrest and deport her. What do we know about that case? MCADAMS: Yeah that's right so this woman's name is Yunseo Chung. She's a junior at Columbia. She was arrested at a pro-Palestinian protest here in New York City earlier this month and now she could look at deportation here. She originally moved here from South Korea and is a legal permanent resident but as we've heard the Secretary of State says it's just not enough when they're arrested at these pro-Palestinian protests. Now she says ICE has a warrant for her arrests so we'll file that case. John? ROBERTS: All right we'll be looking forward to your coverage. Alexis McAdams for us. Alexis, thank you. MCMAHON: Thanks. ROBERTS: A federal judge in California shooting from the hip Appeals Court Judge Lawrence VanDyke is receiving both criticism and praise after taking to social media to explain his dissent to a controversial gun law decision. Our National Correspondent William La Jeunesse has got the story from Los Angeles. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JUDGE LAWRENCE VANDYKE, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS NINTH CIRCUIT: Hi I'm Judge VanDyke and welcome to my chambers. WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Two things here you've never seen before. A federal judge from the liberal Ninth Circuit in San Francisco with an AK-47 hanging on his wall. Second Judge Lawrence VanDyke posted part of his dissent on YouTube. A first in court history. VANDYKE: I'm sure I could explain all this in writing without being accused of improper fact-finding but it's obviously much more effective to simply show you. LA JEUNESSE: In a show-and-tell the Trump appointed judge argues California's ban on so called high-capacity magazines violates the Constitution. VANDYKE: Like many of this courts ideas about the Second Amendment it stems from a basic misunderstanding of how firearms work. LA JEUNESSE: VanDyke's video came after losing seven to four with the courts liberals upholding California's ban on magazines holding more than ten rounds. MARSHA BERZON, SENIOR JUDGE: There hasn't been a dissent. LA JEUNESSE: Clinton appointee Judge Marsha Berzon didn't appreciate his novel dissent saying, ""While the facts Judge VanDyke asserts must be ignored his wildly improper video presentation warrants additional comment, lest the genre proliferate."" Others disagree. BILL BOCK, ATTORNEY: It was fabulous. It helped me to understand a relatively complex issue that would have taken you know, probably 30 pages to explain. LA JEUNESSE: VanDyke argues magazines are not accessories but part of the gun itself. VANDYKE: The entire handgun here including the grip, this takedown lever, the slide and barrel, the sighting system and this magazine are all part of the arm within the meaning of the Second Amendment. Thank you for watching. (END VIDEOTAPE) LA JEUNESSE: For years the Ninth Circuit posted oral arguments most getting no more than a few thousand views but more than 200,000 have already watched Judge VanDyke's dissent most in court history. John? ROBERTS: Interesting development. William La Jeunesse for us. William, thank you. Up next our examination of the COVID pandemic five years later. Bret Baier shows us what happened behind the scenes to ensure medical supplies stayed stocked. And later the panel on the Democrats identity crisis and the Republic effort to club -- to curb rather judicial influence on White House policies. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ROBERTS: Tonight, we continue our series looking back five years after the coronavirus pandemic began. In the initial months, there were fears of widespread shortages, especially when it came to hospital equipment. Bret Baier takes a closer look at how officials work to prevent critical shortfalls. Bret? BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST: Thanks, John. By the end of March, most states had issued stay-at-home orders, closed schools and businesses, and stockpiled equipment for an expected increase in hospitalizations. Tonight, we take a look at some of the initial calls to action, the shortages in supplies, and how much of that information came during briefings at this hour, 6 p.m. Eastern Time. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BAIER: President Trump in the White House briefing room. Good evening. I'm Bret Baier. You've been watching the White House Coronavirus Task Force briefing here on Special Report. BAIER (voice-over): Throughout the spring of 2020, White House briefings were a nightly occurrence. We had a full show. We want to bring you these briefings as they happen. Those briefings often brought new guidance, recommendations and announcements about shortages and supplies as the country sought to tackle the pandemic. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hand sanitizer is going to be very difficult to have 100% in stock on for some time. BAIER: Supply chain shortages during the coronavirus pandemic ranged from food to cleaning products and household items. DONALD TRUMP (R), U.S. PRESIDENT: There's no need for anybody in the country to hoard essential food supplies. MIKE PENCE, (R) THEN U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: We continue at the president's direction to pursue every means to expand the supply of personal protective equipment. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you are sitting on a warehouse with masks, surgical masks, you will be hearing a knock on your door. BAIER: The Trump administration and the general public worked to address the shortages. TRUMP: Companies that made whiskey, that made alcohol, they've now gone very quickly into the hand sanitizers. BAIER: But one of the biggest fears for leaders was a shortage in medical equipment. TRUMP: Well, New York wanted 40,000 ventilators. OK, 40,000. Think of what 40,000 is. It's like cars. It's a big project. It's a -- it's an expensive product. BAIER: According to the World Economic Forum in 2019, the entire planet required just 77,000 new ventilators. New York City alone was requesting around half of what the world received the year before. GOV. ANDREW CUOMO, (D-NY): Have we saved everyone? No. But have we lost anyone because we didn't have a bed or we didn't have a ventilator or we didn't have health care staff? No. BAIER: The U. S. Government began contracting with private companies, including car makers like General Motors, to produce ventilators. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Everybody knows their part. BAIER: Of the around 140,000 machines added to the strategic national stockpile, half were basic breathing devices that did not meet minimum requirements. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When you say, well, we have to be rationing. Yeah, we're already rationing, for God's sakes. BAIER: While rationing was a concern, it was never a reality. But training staff to operate the 15 new types of ventilators presented additional hurdles. TRUMP: We're now supplying ventilators to the entire world. Nobody else has done that. Nobody else. People don't -- countries don't have ventilators. They called the United States. BAIER: Many of the ventilators overseas were not compatible with infrastructure in other countries. And with the new influx of machines, yearly maintenance costs would rise to hundreds of millions of dollars. TRUMP: It looks like we're in great shape from the bed standpoint. It looks like we're in great shape from the ventilator standpoint. BAIER: The Army Corps of Engineers built field hospitals across the country at the price of more than $660 million. But many never treated a single patient. TRUMP: And we built 2900 incredible beds, but they never really had too much use for it. BAIER: By the end of April, President Trump was optimistic about the country reopening, but with some restrictions. (On camera): With the people who say it doesn't track with opening up the country to shut down immigration. TRUMP: Well, I think it really does. I think it's very strong, obviously, and it's countrywide as opposed to specifically like China or some of the other ones that I've shut down. So we'll see you all tomorrow, and we'll have some interesting things to put out tonight. And I appreciat",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 use that slot a lot. BAIER: Get on, Mr. President. TRUMP: We want to have you back soon. Thank you very much. (END VIDEOTAPE) BAIER (voice-over): Between March and April of 2020 Special Report carried President Trump's press briefing in 26 of our 44 shows. While the shortages warned about in those briefings turned out to be less severe than projected, experts say the true shortage was in health care workers. Next, we'll take a look at another shortage that became a mandate, masks. How that guidance changed over the course of the pandemic. Send it back to you. ROBERTS: All right, thanks. We're looking forward to that Bret. Coming up next, the panel on the Republican push to rein in judges' ruling against the Trump administration. Plus, the Democrats and their identity crisis. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MIKE WALTZ, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: We cannot have district judges interfering with the commander in chief's actions to take care of in the way he deems necessary a terrorist organization. REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): The courts are working. They're doing their job. We've got to play these cases out in court. The Trump administration has just thrown caution to the winds. PAM BONDI, GENERAL ATTORNEY: These judges are out of control. We are going to fight back. We are going to win, and the Supreme Court will be ready to hear these cases. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: A record amount of intervention by federal judges into the president's agenda. Let's chew it over with our panel. Byron York, Chief Political Correspondent," the """"Washington Examiner", Matt Bennett," former Deputy Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Affairs under Bill Clinton and Co-Founder of """"Third Way."""" We've got to get some more into that title. And Mollie Hemingway"," Editor-in-Chief at """"The Federalist."""" So here's what Elon Musk tweeted about what's going on in the courts", particularly related to immigration in the whole TDA affair. He said, quote," """"This is the fundamental question. Why did the federal judiciary turn a blind eye to the importation of millions of illegals but is now apoplectic over any action to remove them? How is this anything other than extremely partisan politics masquerading as jurisprudence?"""" Matt is the lone Democrat in the room. You want to tackle that? MATT BENNETT", THIRD WAY CO-FOUNDER: I mean, that's just not how this works. The judges decide cases that come before them. They don't choose the cases. And what this judge -- ROBERTS: But the cases get shopped around to friendly judges. BENNETT: That does happen sometimes, and it happened under President Biden as well, where there was one judge in Texas that heard a whole bunch of cases being brought by people who didn't like President Biden. The thing is, we had judicial review in this country for more than 200 years, and it is a vital check in our checks and balances system. We have caught with Congress, the president and the judiciary, and they are supposed to be equal. If one branch ignores another branch doing their job, that is incredibly dangerous. There's a process. If you don't like what a judge does, you appeal, and ultimately you can appeal the Supreme Court, as the attorney general said. That's how you deal with it. ROBERTS: Well, that's -- that's what they're doing right now in the D.C. Court of Appeals. But the case that the Trump administration is making, Mollie, is that this judge did not have stuck his nose into this case at all, because this is being done under the rubric of foreign policy and national security. MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, THE FEDERALIST: Yeah, there are many issues going on here. If you look back at the first Trump administration, what we saw was the administrative state just saying President Trump doesn't get to do his job. They did the Russia collusion hoax. They did the Ukraine impeachment, and they did all these things to thwart the Trump administration because they didn't like that he disagreed with their foreign policy. So in the second Trump administration, you have them saying we're going to take on the administrative state, and that's what's bringing on this sort of judicial coup. You have people of well-funded, well-coordinated legal campaign to shop certain cases to certain Democrat appointed judges, who are then doing injunctions on a scale that we have never seen before. It's true that it's happened for other presidents, but nothing like what it happens for Trump. And the goal is to thwart him from actually running the country, and Americans don't like that because we don't have much recourse for stopping, say, an invasion of immigrants that are allowed in by the previous president, other than electing a different president, and that's being thwarted through this, through these shenanigans. ROBERTS: You know, when you look back over the last few presidents, there's a record number of injunctions that have been ordered against Donald Trump, 64 in his first term, 15 so far in the last two months, which is one more than the Biden administration had during its entire four years. And remember what Elena Kagan said back on September the 14th,2022, about nationwide injunctions. Listen here. JUSTICE ELENA KAGAN, U.S. SUPREME COURT: That can't be right, that one district court, whether it's in, you know, in the Trump years, people used to go to the Northern District of California, and in the Biden years, they go to Texas. And it just can't be right that one district judge can stop a nationwide policy in its tracks and leave it stopped for the years that it takes to go through a normal process. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: So even Justice Elena Kagan said this isn't right, and yet it's happening every day. BYRON YORK, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Speaking of district court judges in California, there's one right now who is trying to tell the Trump administration that it can't fire anybody in the executive branch, and anybody who's been laid off has to be given their job back. You know, in a popular sense, I think Musk has a very good point, which is, why is it constitutional for Joe Biden to allow 10 million people to enter the country illegally, and for many of them to stay? And why is it unconstitutional for Donald Trump to try to send them back? That said, I think the administration would have been a lot better off if it had really offered proof that had been very careful in determining that each one of these people on this plane being sent to El Salvador actually was a TDA member, and that they had proof on all of that. ROBERTS: Yeah, well, I guess they went a lot by tattoos, which could go some distance at least to identify them. YORK: Well, they tell the story, yeah. ROBERTS: Yes, they do tell a story. Let's talk about the Democrats, because -- Matt," I know this is your favorite topic. """"Axios"""" saying that the Democrats are in a deep", dark hole. Certainly there are approvals in the toilet. This is what we found in a recent Fox News poll. Republicans enjoying record-high approval ratings in Congress at 43%. Democrats, slightly above their low of 30%. You had a big retreat out there in Virginia not long ago, where you had some suggestions for the Democratic Party to get back on track. They're not listening to you. BENNETT: Not yet. We're only two months into the Trump administration. We've got a long way to go before anyone's on any ballots, and so it's a reckoning that has to take place when you lose a big election, and we just lost a big election, and now we're being confronted by really unprecedented action by the president, whether you like it or not. I mean, it is -- what he's doing is enormous and everywhere, and Democrats are having a hard time figuring out where and how to respond. I think they will get their act together, but it is going to take a little while before they have a kind of concerted and joint response. What we've seen so far, the kind of infighting over the continuing resolution, the stuff with AOC and Bernie out on the stump, that's not helpful. We're going to need to turn that around and make sure that voters see Democrats as the kind of -- ROBERTS: Bernie and AOC out there are not -- that's not helpful. BENNETT: I mean, they're firing up the base, but they're not convincing anybody who is ambivalent about what the president is doing that what he's doing is wrong. ROBERTS: All right," well listen to what """"NBC News"""" said about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. """"As Democrats scramble to find an authentic and effective messenger for the second Trump administration", there is a growing desire to elevate Ocasio- Cortez,35, within the party in some way. According to interviews with a dozen Democratic lawmakers, aides, and strategists," especially after last week government spending showdown left the base enraged."""" I'm sure there's a lot of Republicans out there who say", yes, please do that, but what does this mean for the Democratic Party that the person that they want to elevate is one of the most far-left people in the party? MCMAHON: Right, every time someone has a really big loss, they like to think, the party will say, oh it's not us, it's not our ideas, it's that we had a bad messenger or the way that we communicated it was bad, and that can even be true. That's not the situation here. The Democrat Party's problems is that their ideas are really on the wrong side of those 80-20, 90-10 equations, whether it's the transing of children or censorship of speech or America last foreign policy or its stagnant economy. All of these issues are so bad that I think that what people are starting to realize is that the midterms might be very different from what you normally see where the rule where the party in power loses quite a bit. The popularity of the Democratic Party is so low that you might see actually record numbers for Republicans, which is how bad the situation is for Democrats. ROBERTS: And then there's Chuck Schumer, who I don't want to say he's fighting for his political life because I don't think it's come to that, but there's more pressure on him. Listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KRISTEN WELKER, NBC NEWS ANCHOR: Leader Schumer, are you feeling pressure to step down? SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): Look, I'm not stepping down. WELKER: Are you making the same mistake that President Biden did? SCHUMER: No, absolutely not. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: He's not dead man walking yet. YORK: Well, when you say I'm not going to step down, that means you might step down, I think. So he is actually in trouble. And there is, I mean, the Bernie-AOC tour is a real preview of a generational change coming in the Democratic Party. I mean, we've just had the world's oldest president who just left office because he was no longer up to actually doing the job. And they're going to have to find a younger generation of leadership. Schumer's clearly on the tail end of his career as a leader. That change has happened in the Senate for Republicans. It's going to have to happen for Republicans on the presidential level when their 82-year-old president leaves office in in '28. So this generational change is coming and Schumer cannot put it off. ROBERTS: All right, but for the meantime, Matt, long-suffering Bennett, will continue to be. Thanks very much, folks. Really appreciate it. And finally, tonight, a special day. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): Happy, joyful, I don't know. My heart was bursting. I didn't think I would feel this way. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: During Pope Francis' five-week hospitalization, one woman made it her daily routine to bring prayers and yellow roses to the hospital where the pope was staying. When the pope made his first public appearance on Sunday, the 79-year old's effort did not go unrecognized. Pope Francis acknowledged her presence and said, the woman was good. The yellow roses symbolize the Vatican flag. Wow. Tomorrow, in Special Report Bret Baier continues our series," looking back at the coronavirus pandemic. We will take a look at the masking guidance and the inconsistent messaging in the early days of the pandemic. Thanks so much for inviting us into your home tonight. I'll see you again tomorrow evening. That's it for this Special Report. I'm John Roberts in Washington. The Ingraham Angle is next.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Have a great night. JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Good evening and welcome to Washington. I'm John Roberts in for Bret Baier this evening. Coming up, as Democrats search for a message to voters, one progressive congresswoman is not backing down from provocative remarks mocking her state's governor. Plus, a new lawsuit suggests a former Columbia University student activist may have had prior knowledge of the October 7th attack against Israel. And Russia and Ukraine agree to a cease fire in a crucial and strategic waterway. But first, breaking tonight, President Trump is reaffirming his support for national security adviser, Michael Waltz as the administration defends itself against a slew of criticism over the accidental messaging of U.S. military plans in Yemen to a reporter with The Atlantic magazine. The president and his security team maintain that no classified information was shared, an assertion that seems to be at odds with the report in The Atlantic. The mistake is raising questions over how something like this could ever happen and renewing concerns about the handling of sensitive information. Our Senior White House Correspondent Jacqui Heinrich following the story, she's live from the North Lawn. Good evening, Jacqui. JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, John. The administration is casting this story as an attempt to distract from the president's successes, from a discredited reporter at a failing magazine. They dispute how sensitive the conversation really was, also saying that texts on that encrypted app Signal were approved for government use last year under Biden. That said, Google warned just last month that this app was vulnerable to spies. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: He's a very good man, and he will continue to do a good job. HEINRICH (voice over): President Trump standing by his National Security Adviser after he inadvertently invited the editor in chief of The Atlantic to a group text with top cabinet officials as the U.S. military readied strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. TRUMP: No, I don't think he should apologize. I think he's doing his best. It's equipment and technology that's not perfect, and probably he won't be using it again. The main thing was, nothing happened. The attack was totally successful. HEINRICH (voice over): Officials aggressively pushing back on the reporter's characterization of what he saw. PETE HEGSETH, DEFENSE SECRETARY: Nobody was texting war plans, and that's all I have to say about that. Thank you. HEINRICH (voice over): Jeffrey Goldberg, considering releasing more screenshots. JEFFREY GOLDBERG, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE ATLANTIC: No, that's a lie. He was texting war plans, how they were going to be targeted, who was at the targets, when the next sequence of attacks were happening. HEINRICH: The debate over whether the information was classified, shaping the administration's defense. MIKE WALTZ, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: I think there's a lot of the lessons. There's a lot of journalists in this city who have made big names for themselves making up lies about this president and this one in particular, I've never met, don't know, never communicated with. HEINRICH (voice over): Goldberg, stated in his report he's met Waltz in the past, but the jury is out on his telling of what he saw. MIKE POMPEO, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: None has seen that. We'll have to see what was there. I mean, if you had -- if you had targeting information, the like, whether it's formerly classified, it is very sensitive. HEINRICH (voice over): The administration says it's investigating how Goldberg's number was added to a staffers contact card. Meantime, the president says he'd prefer sensitive conversations happen offline. TRUMP: Look, if it was up to me, everybody would be sitting in a room together. The room would have solid lead walls and a lead ceiling and a lead floor. But you know, life doesn't always let you do that. (END VIDEOTAPE) HEINRICH (on camera): Today, the CIA director testified in a hearing that he has no way of telling whether Defense Secretary Hegseth declassified information in that group text, or when. The president said, as far as he is aware, nothing that was revealed was classified. But he deferred to Hegseth on whether he would be comfortable with the remaining messages getting out publicly, John. ROBERTS: All right, we'll see if Goldberg chooses to release any more of the messages that he received. Meantime, the vice president, who appeared to challenge the president's thinking in those messages, is headed to Greenland this week. What do we know about that? HEINRICH: Yes, John. The second lady planned to visit Greenland to visit some historical sites and attend a dog sled race. Denmark's Prime Minister framed her visit as another wave of unacceptable pressure, their words, given the president's desire to take over Greenland. Now, the vice president is joining. He and the second lady will get a briefing at the space base over Arctic security issues, John. ROBERTS: All right, we look forward to the coverage of that. Jacqui Heinrich live for us tonight. Jacqui, thank you. The inadvertent text took center stage at today's worldwide threats hearing, three of President's Trump -- three of President Trump's top intelligence officials were grilled on that today. Here's our Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Democrats apoplectic. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think it's the dumbest thing I've seen. PERGRAM (voice over): Bewildered the officials inadvertently looping in a journalist to a group chat on Signal. SEN. MARK WARNER (D-VA): I think this is one more example of the kind of sloppy, careless, incompetent behavior, particularly towards classified information. PERGRAM (voice over): Senators demanding answers about the digital misfire. WARNER: Did you participate in the group chat with Secretary of Defense and other Trump senior officials? TULSI GABBARD, FORMER HAWAII REPRESENTATIVE: Senator, I don't want to get into this -- WARNER: Ma'am, did you -- where you on -- you're not going to be willing to address? So, you're not -- are you denying -- Ma'am, will you answer my question, Ma'am? PERGRAM (voice over): Signal is an encrypted chat app, which the CIA allows on a limited basis. JOHN RATCLIFFE, CIA DIRECTOR: The use of Signal message, end to end encryption applications is permissible and was, in this case, used permissibly. PERGRAM (voice over): Gabbard said the bungled text divulged no top secret information. GABBARD: There was no classified material that was shared. SEN. JACK REED (D-RI): If that's true, the administration should immediately provide a copy of the group chat to Congress. PERGRAM (voice over): The messages reportedly revealed striking views about European allies. Vice President Vance texting, he hated, ""bailing out the Europeans again."" Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth despising what he called European free-loading. (CROSSTALK) SEN. JOHN THUNE (R-SD): Well, any, you know, text chains that are exchanged privately, I think you have to put that into context for what it is. PERGRAM (voice over): Some Republicans tried to give the officials a pass. Others shot the messenger. REP. DARRELL ISSA (R-CA): But The Atlantic did by making public something that they believed could have been national security sensitive, is the kind of irresponsible activity of the press. (END VIDEOTAPE) PERGRAM (on camera): Mark Warner was furious about the Yemen text chain, but in 2017 he used a non-encrypted app to text with a Russian oligarch. Warner was trying to get info about the Steele dossier and President Trump. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries just wrote to the President. He demands the firing of Hegseth, John. ROBERTS: All right, something about stones and glass houses comes to mind. Chad Pergram for us. Chad, thank you. Stocks headed in positive territory after a choppy trading session today, the Dow added four, the S&P 500 was up nine. The NASDAQ gained 83. Not a bad day all around. Some pro-Palestinian protesters at Columbia University are facing a major allegation in a new lawsuit tonight. In part, the legal action alleges that activist and former Columbia Graduate Student Mahmoud Khalil and several student groups helped Hamas continue acts of terrorism. Correspondent Alexis McAdams is in a familiar place. She's at Columbia University with the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALEXIS MCADAMS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Tonight, the families of hostages who were being held captive and likely killed by Hamas suing pro-Palestinian protesters at Columbia University, alleging the groups are aiding and abetting Hamas. The families believe these groups knew the October 7th attack on Israel was coming, saying the Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine group posted this on their Instagram page just minutes before the attack, writing, we are back. The lawsuit calls out Mahmoud Khalil by name, the Colombia activist was arrested by ICE and is fighting deportation, as authorities say he's a national security threat. Now, Khalil suing the administration, saying this is a violation of his free speech. TOM DUPREE, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL: The First Amendment does protect the right to free speech, but that right does not extend to aiding and abetting designated terrorist groups. MCADAMS (voice over): Also fighting deportation. Yunseo Chung, a Columbia student who was arrested at this protest at Barnard College this month. DHS says she's engaged in concerning conduct. ICE looking for Chung, who's originally from South Korea and has a green card, but a new court order will temporarily prevent her deportation. RAMZI KASSEM, ATTORNEY: As of today, Yunseo Chung no longer has to fear and live in fear of ICE coming to her doorstep and abducting her in the night as they did Mr. Khalil. MCADAMS (voice over): Cornell grad student Momodou Taal is suing the administration. Taal, who's a British Gambian student, was nearly suspended for protesting at Cornell, which would have threatened his F-1 visa status. (END VIDEOTAPE) MCADAMS (on camera): So tonight, as you can see, John, there are a lot of those lawsuits rolling in. ICE is asking that Momodou Taal, that student out at Cornell turn himself in, nothing on that yet. And back here at Columbia, we reached out to the Students for Justice in Palestine group about that explosive lawsuit. Haven't heard back yet, John. ROBERTS: Alexis McAdams is up at Columbia. Alexis, thank you so much. Delegations from Russia and Ukraine have agreed to a cease fire in the Black Sea following talks with Trump administration officials in Saudi Arabia. But there is skepticism tonight about the scope of the deal and if it will hold. Correspondent Alex Hogan has got the latest. She's in London tonight. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALEX HOGAN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Agreed terms to a maritime truce, both Russia and Ukraine green lighting a plan to pause the fighting in the Black Sea, the critical defensive body of water on which both countries also rely for exports. It's the first significant step toward a full cease fire amid U.S. President Donald Trump's pledge to swiftly end the war. The deal also includes a ban on targeting energy infrastructure for 30 days, a promise Russia says it will only trust with Washington's backing. SERGEY LAVROV, RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER (through translator): We will need clear guarantees. The guarantees can only be the result of an order from Washington to Zelenskyy and to his team to do one thing and not the other. HOGAN (voice over): Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he believes the peace plan goes into effect immediately, although he expressed doubt that Moscow will hold up its end of the bargain. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): If the Russians violate this, then I have a direct question for President Trump, if they violate and here is the evidence. We ask for sanctions, we ask for weapons and so on. HOGAN (voice over): U.S. and Ukrainian delegates met in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia today, following talks between the U.S. and Russia. In separate agreements, the U.S. will help both countries on different fronts, the U.S. and Ukraine agreed to continue to work toward the exchange of prisoners of war, the release of civilian detainees and the return of forcibly transferred Ukrainian children. The Trump administration has also agreed to help Russia increase its global exports of grain and fertilizer. Not all details are finalized. The Kremlin warns first sanctions must be lifted and it won't give up control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. TRUMP: About five or six conditions. We're looking at all of them. HOGAN (voice over): Despite days of diplomatic efforts in the Middle East, in Eastern Europe, the fighting rages on. Both countries today accuse the other of continued attacks. (END VIDEOTAPE) HOGAN (on camera): The White House says that this is the first step in securing lasting peace, and that U.S. officials will continue to facilitate talks between both sides moving forward, John. ROBERTS: Alex Hogan in London. Alex, thank you. Up next, as Democrats search for an identity, one outspoken congresswoman is getting a lot of attention for all the wrong reasons, we'll explain. First, Beyond our Borders tonight, Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip kill at least 23 Palestinians. According to the Hamas controlled Gaza health ministry, the Israeli military is expanding evacuation orders to tens of thousands of residents across the Enclave. Israel resumed its campaign against Hamas in Gaza weeks ago, breaking a two month long cease fire. Battle of Brazilian Supreme Court justices has begun proceedings to determine whether former President Jair Bolsonaro will stand trial on counts that include attempting to stage a coup. Bolsonaro was charged last month with plotting a coup over his 2022 election loss to the current president Louis Lula da Silva. And this is a live look at London, one of the big stories there tonight, five lions rescued from the war zone in Ukraine are settling into their new home in England. All five were found near the front line in Ukraine's war against Russian invasion. Officials say they were originally from the Illegal Pet and Wildlife Trade. The lions will remain at The Big Cat Sanctuary in the United Kingdom. Just some of the other stories Beyond our Borders tonight, we will be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ROBERTS: ""BREAKING TONIGHT"", President Trump has signed an executive order requiring people to provide documentation proving they are citizens, when they register to vote. The measure also seeks to withhold federal election funding from states that do not comply with the directive. The order also attempts to bar states from counting mail ballots that election officials receive after Election Day. Texas Democratic Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett is facing a flurry of backlash over recent inflammatory remarks targeting her governor, Greg Abbott. It's the latest in a wave of controversial comments by the second- term representative. Correspondent Alexandria Hoff is following it all, and she joins us now. Good evening, Alex. ALEXANDRIA HOFF, FOX NEWS CHANNEL WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Well, good evening to you, John. Well, speaking at a Human Rights Campaign gala, Congresswoman Crockett was criticizing Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott's policies, and made this remark. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JASMINE CROCKETT (D-TX): You all know, we got Governor Hot Wheels down there. Come on now. And the only thing hot about him is that he is a hot ass mess. (END VIDEO CLIP) HOFF: But she says, Hot Wheels there. And Governor Abbott has used a wheelchair since 1984 when he was paralyzed by a falling tree while out for a jog. Texas Republican Senator John Cornyn, called Crockett remarks, shameful. This afternoon, Representative Crockett offered a defense, writing in part, ""I wasn't thinking about the governor's condition. I was thinking about the planes, trains, and automobiles used to transfer migrants."" ""And at no point did I mention or allude to his condition."" Crockett said she found it appalling to be criticized by President Trump supporters, saying that they support ""a man known for racially insensitive nicknames and mocking those with disabilities."" Fellow Texas representative Randy Weber, a Republican, revealed to Fox News Digital that he is filing a censure resolution over Crockett Saturday remarks, calling them discriminatory. And this backlash comes as Crockett was already forced to defend these comments made about Elon Musk and Senator Ted Cruz. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CROCKETT: It's Ted Cruz. I mean, like, this dude has to be knocked over the head, like, hard. Right? All I want to see happen on my birthday is for Elon to be taken down. (END VIDEO CLIP) HOFF: Now, the congresswoman maintains she is not promoting any illegal activity or violence. Her comments on Musk prompted Attorney General Pam Bondi to warn Crockett, to ""tread lightly."" John. ROBERTS: All right. Alexandria Hoff with the latest on that. Alexandria, thank you. The Trump administration is moving to freeze tens of millions of dollars in federal family planning grants to certain organizations. That's according to The Wall Street Journal. The pause is to give the administration time to investigate whether the money was used for diversity efforts. The groups that would be subject to the freeze, which include Planned Parenthood affiliates, were set to get about $120 million this year. Well, House and Senate Democrats are huddling behind closed doors after a week's worth of brutal town halls that reportedly made some lawmakers cry. Our senior national correspondent Aishah Hasnie takes a look at the Democrats search for a strategy on Capitol Hill. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): -- if not. AISHAH HASNIE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Peter Doocy was talking AOC, your New York colleague recently. HASNIE (voice over): Senate Democrat Leader Chuck Schumer, ignoring Fox's questions today about Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive powerhouse, positioning herself to lead the party as it recalibrates. REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): We have to continue standing up and fighting for people. HASNIE (voice over): House and Senate Democrats strategizing today behind closed doors. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think the Democratic Party needs to transform and improve, both in message and in substance. HASNIE (voice over): But divisions linger. Today, former Speaker, Nancy Pelosi pushing back on Democrats eating their own. REP. NANCY PELOSI, (D-CA): I'd rather use our resources to add to our numbers than to have an internal fight. HASNIE (voice over): After news of a far-left influencer, primarying incumbent Jan Schakowsky caught the House Democrat leader off guard. REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): I'm not familiar with what you're talking about. HASNIE (voice over): Still, there is a stark difference in the two chambers. House Democrats appear to be unified behind their leader. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is Leader Jeffries, the leader of the Democratic Party going forward? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He is the -- he is a titular head of the party, absolutely. HASNIE (voice over): While Senate Democrats are dodging questions about theirs. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Senator Sanders, do you have confidence in Leader Schumer? (END VIDEOTAPE) HASNIE (on camera): And John, Republicans are watching all of this, paying attention to it, especially trying to figure out how this might affect them in the midterms. For example, today, the GOP conference chair, Lisa McClain claimed that it's ""extreme socialists"" are now the leaders of the Democratic Party. Of course, she is referring to AOC and Bernie Sanders. Well, House Speaker Mike Johnson advised Democrats to basically support the GOP's common-sense agenda, get with the program in order to turn their polling around. John? ROBERTS: Well, there are some moderate voices. Nobody is listening at this point. (CROSSTALK) HASNIE: Some. ROBERTS: We'll see if they do. Aishah, thank you. Up next, an exclusive ride along as law enforcement in Florida steps up their game to crack down on illegal immigration. Plus, Tesla owners and dealerships on edge, the latest on the investigations and crackdowns on acts of violence. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ROBERTS: Officials in Florida are sharing the wealth when it comes to cracking down on illegal immigration. The state is the first in the nation to have every sheriff's office join the task force that gives them certain powers of an ICE agent. Correspondent, Danamarie McNicholl is in St Augustine with a front row seat to the partnership. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SGT. BOBBY KUKAR, DEPUTY, SHERIFF'S OFFICE, ST. JOHNS COUNTY, FLORIDA: I don't think anybody knew how bad the immigration problem was. DANAMARIE MCNICHOLL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): With more than a million illegal immigrants targeted for deportation in the U.S., the feds are getting some much-needed help from local law enforcement. Florida is leading the charge with ICE's 287 (g) program prohibited by President Obama in 2012, but revived under President Trump, it allows local cops to be trained and given certain powers of an ICE agent, such as verifying pending removal orders and asking for documentation during their day-to-day work. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He is here, illegally. MCNICHOLL (voice over): This partnership eliminates the need to involve federal agents on immigration arrest warrants. KUKAR: It will stream on it just like that. We'll be able to get the information back whether we have a reason to hold them or we don't have a reason to hold them. MCNICHOLL (voice over): The St. Johns County Sheriff's Office patrols a busy stretch of highway 95, just south of Jacksonville. MCNICHOLL: This started as a routine traffic stop for speeding. But officers found at least two passengers with removal orders for deportation. MCNICHOLL (voice over): Deputies stopped another driver for expired tags, but the driver and his passengers didn't want to get out of the car. Officers had to break the window to get them out. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Get out now. MCNICHOLL: Agents say the passengers who were working for a landscaping company will now face an immigration judge. ROBERT HARDWICK, SHERIFF, ST. JOHNS COUNTY, FLORIDA: You don't run from us in St John's County Sheriff's Office. You don't roll your window up, and you're here illegally on a traffic stop, because you don't have a photo driver's license, and think we're just going to walk away from your car that you get away with it. (END VIDEOTAPE) MCNICHOLL: And this agreement also allows local jails to process migrants with criminal charges. The Sheriff's Office says this will speed up deportations. Right now, John, there are 25 states that have opted into this partnership. ROBERTS: Vigorous program down there in the Sunshine State. Danamarie McNicholl for us. Danamarie, thank you. The Trump administration is being allowed, for now at least, to suspend admitting new refugees into the United States. A federal appeals court blocked the judge's order to continue the resettlement program while the case is being litigated. Refugees admitted into the U.S. before President Trump took office will still be processed for entry. Now an update on a story that we brought you last night. Authorities still searching for answers after incendiary devices were found at a Tesla showroom in Austin, Texas. It is one of many recent examples of acts of violence and vandalism against the electric vehicle maker. Correspondent Brooke Taylor has that story from the Tesla dealership. Good evening, Brooke. BROOKE TAYLOR, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: White House officials -- yesterday, the FBI says they are working with the ATF right now to investigate. And besides some police presence in the parking lot earlier, it's really business as usual out here with customers going in and out of the store all day long. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BROOKE (voice-over): White House officials say more arrests are coming following a string of targeted attacks on Tesla dealerships, cars and charging stations across the country. The latest incident happening at a dealership in Austin, Texas where a bomb squad was called Monday morning. Police say they found multiple devices that could be used to set off fires. The same dealership has been the center of peaceful protests for weeks now. JIMMY FLANNIGAN, PROTESTER: This is insane. And we cannot stand for this unelected person wielding almost unlimited power throughout our government. BROOKE (voice-over): Since Elon Musk took on his role with DOGE, the FBI says there have been nearly 50 targeted attacks in at least nine states. Just last week, someone torched several Teslas at a dealership in Las Vegas and even fired shots into the vehicles. A day before that, a cyber-truck was set on fire in the parking lot of a Tesla dealership in Kansas City. Innocent Tesla owners are also being targeted with videos circulating online showing cars getting keyed and vandalized. Hours after the latest incident in Austin, the FBI announced a new task force to crack down on these attacks. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: They're going to suffer very grave consequences because they're really terrorists when you think about it. BROOKE (voice-over): FBI Director Kash Patel took to X and said in part, quote, ""This is domestic terrorism. Those responsible will be pursued, caught and brought to justice."" Attorney General Pam Bondi with this strong warning. PAM BONDI, ATTORNEY GENERAL: We have charged multiple people. Get ready. There are more coming. (END VIDEOTAPE) BROOKE (on camera): And meanwhile, protests are expected across the world over the weekend right now. According to the Tesla takedown movement's website, it says they have declared March 29th as a global day of action. Their website states that they are promoting peaceful protests, though, and they are against any type of violence or vandalism. We're going to keep an eye on those protests to see what happens here, John. ROBERTS: All right, Brooke Taylor for us with the latest on that. Brooke, thank you. A federal appeals court is temporarily blocking a federal judge's order which blocked DOGE from looking into USAID. The stay will only remain in effect until the end of Thursday, presumably until the appeals court can issue a further order on enforcement. The order means for now, DOGE can continue dealing with USAID. Elon Musk and top members of DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency, will join Special Report on Thursday to discuss their efforts in cracking down on waste, fraud and abuse. Do not miss it. Up next, conflicting guidance and information in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic. Bret Baier takes a look at the evolution of masking recommendations five years later. First, here's some of what our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. FOX 13 in Seattle, as court documents reveal, Idaho prosecutors want a judge to reject at least some of murder suspect Brian Kohberger's request to give his family priority seating at his upcoming trial. Kohberger is accused of killing four University of Idaho students back in November of 2022. His trial is scheduled to begin on August the 11th. FOX 8 in Charlotte, as dry conditions, wind and trees down by Hurricane Helene are fueling wildfires in North and South Carolina. Evacuation orders were in effect in parts of both states. So far, no injuries or deaths have been reported. And this is a live look at Madison, Wisconsin. One of the big stories there tonight from FOX 47. A massive turnout during the first week of early voting ahead of Wisconsin's pivotal state Supreme Court race. The election will determine whether the court will remain under four to three liberal control or flip to a conservative majority. One of the current liberal justices is retiring there. And that's tonight's look outside the Beltway from Special Report. We will be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ROBERTS: Tonight, we continue our series looking back five years after the coronavirus pandemic began. In this edition, Bret Baier takes a look at early masking recommendations and the inconsistent messaging at the start of the pandemic. BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Thanks, John. As we mentioned in our earlier series pieces, officials went back and forth on masking guidance. First, because of shortages, and then many began to blame politics. Tonight, we take a look at how that guidance evolved. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MARIA VAN KERKHOVE, AMERICAN EPIDEMIOLOGIST: In the community, we don't recommend the use of wearing masks unless you yourself are sick. BAIER (voice-over): As March turned to April, Americans were practicing social distancing and many were isolating in their homes. But much of the public wanted to know what else they could do to protect themselves from COVID-19. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The roadmap suggests that everybody wear a mask in public. Is that something that the task force thinks is a good idea? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. President, I just wanted to get your thoughts on face masks. We asked you about this yesterday and you signaled you were thinking about it. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There continues to be a lot of public confusion about the use of masks. What about the public? Should we be wearing masks out? We've heard lots of different recommendations. TRUMP: I don't believe -- look, there's a big thing, a lot of people don't like it. Some people don't like it because you're taking it away from the medical professionals. BAIER (voice-over): Many states were reporting shortages in masks. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Our supply has changed in the past few weeks pretty dramatically. BAIER (voice-over): And health officials were still insisting that social distancing and hand washing were the most effective defenses against coronavirus. DEBORAH BIRX, WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE: And we don't want people to get an artificial sense of protection because they're behind a mask. When we're trying to send a signal that every single person in this country needs to stay six feet away from everybody. BAIER (voice-over): In April, there was limited evidence. Masking would make a significant impact on the population at large. There were few studies on mask use for preventing COVID-19. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The average person does not need to wear a surgical mask. BAIER (voice-over): Coronavirus cases were rising to an average of more than 20,000 per day. Daily new cases would remain above that number for more than a year. Even as masking recommendations were implemented. TRUMP: So with the masks, it's going to be really a voluntary thing. You can do it. You don't have to do it. I'm choosing not to do it. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: As soon as I get out of the store, I take it off to get a big breath because, you know, you can't breathe with it on. At least I can. I'm a mouth breather. BAIER (voice-over): Amid the shortage in masks, officials recommended that anything could work so long as it covered your nose and mouth. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The covering can be a scarf, could be a bandana or you can make a face covering out of an old T-shirt. BAIER (voice-over): Many Americans got to work making their own face coverings. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What we have right now is probably about another 400 masks. BAIER (voice-over): Others taught mask-making online. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Just pin that two-inch mark. BAIER (voice-over): As more masks became available, some states and cities began to implement mandates. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today I'm signing an order requiring folks who absolutely have to go out in public to wear a face covering. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All employees of many non-medical essential businesses will be required to wear cloth face coverings. TRUMP: I don't know if you need mandatory because you have many places in the country where people stay very long distance. You talk about social distancing, but I'm all for masks. BAIER (voice-over): While President Trump was against a mask mandate, he supported mask wearing when he thought appropriate. TRUMP: I think it's fine to wear a mask if it makes you feel comfortable. BAIER (voice-over): Many studies reported individuals had a lesser chance of becoming sick if they were consistently using a mask. But few studies provided information about the types of masks worn and how often people complied with wear",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: As I said all along, where I have authority, mandating masks be worn. BAIER (voice-over): As President Biden came into office, he implemented more strict masking guidance, requiring face coverings for federal workers and travelers. Cases would still remain above 20,000 a day until June 2021, when many people began to get vaccinated. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We really need to continue the other non-vaccine interventions as this rollout goes forward, and that of course includes the mask wearing. We're now being recommended perhaps to do double masking. BAIER (voice-over): Some studies found several cities did show fewer coronavirus cases after a mask mandate was implemented, but few took into account other mitigation measures, since many states with mask mandates also had more strict stay-at-home orders. DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE: When you're talking about the effect on the epidemic or the pandemic as a whole, the data are less strong. But when you talk about as an individual basis of someone protecting themselves or protecting themselves from spreading it to others, there's no doubt that there are many studies that show that there is an advantage. BAIER (voice-over): Other doctors and officials pointed out most cases stemmed from places like homes or gatherings with friends where people likely would not be wearing a mask. And due to the effort to save N95s and surgical masks for health professionals, most of the public were wearing cloth masks, which studies found to be less effective. (END VIDEOTAPE) BAIER (on camera): Much of the data officials referenced when issuing new guidance like masking came from other countries. Next, we look at how officials used that to project the severity of the pandemic and how those initial projections did not always come to fruition. Back to you. ROBERTS: All right, we're looking forward to that, Bret. Coming up next, the panel on the fallout over the accidental messaging of U.S. military planes to a reporter in today's worldwide threats hearing. And then, an unusual rescue covering land, air, and sea. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TULSI GABBARD, NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE DIRECTOR: I can attest to the fact that there were no classified or intelligence equities that were included in that chat group. PETE HEGSETH, DEFENSE SECRETARY: Nobody was texting war plans. This is a guy that pedals in garbage. JEFFREY GOLDBER, THE ATLANTIC EDITOR-IN-CHIEF: The secretary of Defense, all due respect, in that presentation seems like a person who is unserious and is trying to deflect. PETE AGUILAR (D-CA), HOUSE DEMOCRATIC CHAIR: These are absolutely reckless national security decisions that put our brave men and women on the front line. It put them at risk. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: Continues to be the talk of the town here in Washington, D.C. How did the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine get on what it was thought to be a very close-hold text chain with some of this nation's top leaders, including the vice president, the secretary of State," and the secretary of Defense? Let's bring in our panel. Josh Holmes is the co-host of the """"Ruthless"""" podcast and former chief of staff to Senator Mitch McConnell. Fox News Senior Political Analyst Juan Williams is here. And Katie Pavlich", news editor at Townhall.com. So let me see, Katie, if I can get you to say something you don't really want to say on T.V. KATIE PAVLICH, TOWNHALL.COM NEWS EDITOR: Good start. ROBERTS: Maybe this operation was not compromised. It doesn't appear as though it was. It came off the way it was supposed to. Maybe this information was not classified or was at the time and was later declassified. But the bottom line is this is as embarrassing as you know what. PAVLICH: Two things can be true at once, and this is something that the president of the United States, you know, acknowledged today, that this was a mistake. This shouldn't have happened. They're dealing with sensitive systems and information and that mistakes were made that he would prefer people get together in the proper place to handle these types of discussions inside of a secure area. The other thing that can be true is that Jeffrey Goldberg from The Atlantic has a long history of exaggerating or putting out false stories that involve the president and not being able to back up his exact claims. We still haven't seen the entirety of these text chains that Jeffrey Goldberg says he still has it. He may release it. The administration officials today on Capitol Hill did not say whether they would release this information. But the bottom line the White House is pushing out is, look, the results of the operation that they were discussing were successful. We're continuing to go after this terrorist organization. And what was underreported during the Biden administration is the scandal that the Houthi terrorists, who was a ragtag group that is backed by the Iranians, was able to launch 174 attacks on U.S. Navy ships, hundreds of attacks on commercial ships as well, shutting down commercial enterprise through the Red Sea. I mean, that is something that was underreported. And the Trump administration is reestablishing dominance in the world and sending a message not just to Iran, but also to countries like China, who may be -- ROBERTS: Yes. PAVLICH: -- thinking about shutting down some of those major waterways. ROBERTS: Well, they certainly are doing something about it. You know, the president, Michael Waltz spoke about this earlier this afternoon. Let's listen to what they said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: The main thing was nothing happened. The attack was totally successful. It was, I guess, from what I understand, took place during and it wasn't classified information. MIKE WALTZ, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: There's a lot of journalists in this city who have made big names for themselves, making up lies about this president, this one in particular. I've never met, don't know, never communicated with, and we are looking into and reviewing how the heck he got into this room. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: So Goldberg wrote a number of articles, one, that the White House insists are not true, was the article about the Aisne-Marne Cemetery when the president was in France. It was the story about needing the kind of generals that Hitler had about not paying for Vanessa Guillen's funeral. I mean, if there's anybody you don't want included in a group text about sensitive information, I think that he would probably be pretty near the top of the list. JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: I think that's right, and I think that, you know, it's one of those kind of jujitsu situations, John. If he is such an incompetent, reckless journalist, well, how did he get on this, you know, secure chat on Signal? I mean, why would he be there? And he was there. To me, it's pretty clear, you know, they should just fess up and move on. Let's just get this out of the way and move on. This is the first time in 70 days of this presidency, really, that the Democrats feel they have a card to play here. And I think it's pretty clear when you look at it, what you see is that this was at least incompetent protection of a military operation. You know, the operational details of a military operation. And so the Democrats today, I think, got Tulsi Gabbard and John Ratcliffe in a trap, which is to say, OK, you say it's not classified, release it. And they can't release it because even if they -- you know, when was it classified? You know, was it Pete Hegseth who declassified it? Is it the case that maybe the national security adviser made a mistake because he was the one in conversation with this journalist and to bring him in? At some point, you have to just say, move on. Look, we made a mistake. And so far, the president and none of those top aides are willing to say that. ROBERTS: Well, I think the president kind of came close today to say it was a mistake. It's not going to happen again. He says that he wants those conversations taking place in a lead-lined room with a lead floor. JOSH HOLMES," """"RUTHLESS"""" PODCAST CO-HOST: Yes. ROBERTS: And everybody in the same room. HOLMES: You know", I think he put a bow on the whole thing. It's obviously a mistake. I think they acknowledge as much. And it is not likely to ever happen again based on the president's comments. But I think something that Juan said actually struck a chord with me in how the Democrats now feel like they're on offense. OK, they're on offense because of a successful mission where the mode of communications was a grievous error, I guess. These are the same Democrats that said absolutely nothing, as Katie said, while 175 different attacks happened on U.S. Navy ships. How is it -- what is it that we're criticizing here? Is it the politics or is it the outcome? And I think the American people over and over again, whether we're talking about taxes or national security, are more interested in the outcome of all these discussions, of which it was perfectly well done. ROBERTS: Yes, it was a rare moment where we heard the Democrats sort of unify on something other than just attacking President Trump. Most of the time, what we hear from the Democrats is what we hear from people like Jasmine Crockett. Listen here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JASMINE CROCKETT (D-TX): It's Ted Cruz. I mean, like, this dude has to be knocked over the head, like, hard, right? Like, there is no niceties with him. Like, at all. Like, you go clean off on him. You all know we got Governor Hot Wheels down there. And the only thing hot about him is that he is a hot-ass mess, honey. On March 29th, it's my birthday, and all I want to see happen on my birthday is for Elon to be taken down. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTS: So calls for her to apologize, Katie, over the comment regarding Governor Abbott, who's been in a wheelchair for 40 years, and then admonitions from Pam Bondi to kind of watch what you say here. PAVLICH: This says a lot about where the Democrats are with their brand. They are more unpopular than they've been in 40 years. And she represents a congressional district in Texas. Well, going back to the hearing today, DNI Gabbard says that the number one threat facing the United States are cartels and gang members operating with transnational organizations to bring drugs and human trafficking into the country. People want real solutions. Americans want adults in charge. And if this is going to be the face of the Democrats moving forward, I think they're going to continue to lose elections. ROBERTS: Juan to Josh, 30 seconds apiece. Are those the people you want talking for the party? WILLIAMS: It's not my language. I think you guys know me, I don't like this kind of language. But I must say it is the language of today's social media political discourse. It's low, and I don't like it. But is it any lower than the kind of language that we've seen from this president? ROBERTS: Yes. WILLIAMS: From President Trump? Remember," he was going after a """"New York Times"""" reporter who had a disability. ROBERTS: But of course", it seems these days if you're a Democrat and you don't curse, you're not with the cool kids. HOLMES: It seems to be a real trend. ROBERTS: Yes. HOLMES: I mean, look, there's a huge, massive void of leadership within the Democratic Party, and that void is being filled by people like Jasmine Crockett, who's elected herself the new spokesperson for the Democratic Party. I, for one, welcome that, and I wish them the best of luck. ROBERTS: When you leave a power vacuum, often strange people step into it. That's right. Thanks, pal. Good to see you. PAVLICH: Thanks, John. ROBERTS: Really appreciate it. And finally, tonight, a special report salute. Check this out. A drone captured the moment three deer were stranded in an icy pond. They were helped to safety by that drone. Police in Green Lake, Wisconsin, where it's still really cold, couldn't get the deer to come out of the water, so they used some aerial maneuvering to herd them toward the shore. Once the deer got close, police were able to use a rope and pulled all of them to safety. That's using a drone for good purposes. Tomorrow on Special Report, our Common Ground segment on a bipartisan bill aimed at restoring American energy dominance through a renewable source. On Thursday, Bret will interview Elon Musk and top members of DOGE to discuss their efforts in cracking down on waste, fraud, and abuse. Remember, if you can't catch us live, set your DVR at 6:00 Eastern, 3:00 on the West Coast. Thanks so much for inviting us into your home tonight. Fair, balanced," and unafraid. That's it for this Special Report. I'm John Roberts in Washington. The """"Ingraham Angle"""" with Laura is up next.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A possible Democratic presidential hopeful splits with the party over a major issue. And China says it is ready for war with the U.S. We'll take a look at its military buildup. BREAM: President Trump is postponing his 25 percent tariffs on many imports from Mexico and some from Canada. The move comes amid much consternation about the economic fallout from the tariffs, including another major sell off on Wall Street. The Dow lost 428. The S&P 500 was off 104. NASDAQ plunged 483. Senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy starts us off live from the North Lawn. Good evening, Peter. PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Shannon. President Trump and his team just still do not think Canada or Mexico are doing enough to stop the flow of fentanyl across their borders. So, some products are going to get a break from these tariffs, but it is just temporary, just for a couple weeks, regardless of market volatility. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I'm not even looking at the market. DOOCY (voice over): The bigger consideration, a continued pressure campaign on Canada. SCOTT BESSENT, UNITED STATES TREASURY SECRETARY: If you want to be a numbskull like Justin Trudeau and say, oh, we're going to do this, then, it's going to -- tariffs are going to go up. DOOCY (voice over): That strategy is confusing to some conservative economists. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right now, just random tariffs at random times, and you can't do any planning that way. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Well -- DOOCY (voice over): Most of the Trump Cabinet sat with Elon Musk today. TRUMP: It was about cutting. DOOCY (voice over): The president explains that now, we say, the scalpel, rather than the hatchet, particularly with federal staffers. TRUMP: I want the Cabinet members to keep good people. I don't want to see a big cut where a lot of good people are cut. DOOCY (voice over): Even with a more precise approach, the president believes DOGE could help achieve a Republican fiscal hawks' dream. TRUMP: I think there is a good chance we could balance the budget next year. DOOCY (voice over): Two days after a joint address that included a reference to being shot in the ear. TRUMP: My life was saved by a fraction of an inch. DOOCY: President Trump says answers about his would-be assassin could be available next week. TRUMP: I want to find the answers, I've told them. I don't want to get too far ahead of my skis, but yes, I wouldn't be very willing to release that, I'd like to see it. I want to see it myself. Yes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: -- President? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: -- Mr. president? TRUMP: Not only you, I want to see that one myself. DOOCY: The president also has a new message for two Starliner astronauts who have been stuck in space for eight months. TRUMP: We love you, and we're coming up to get you, and you shouldn't have been up there so long. Elon is going to go up and get them. Should I go on that journey just to be on the ship when we stop? What do you -- (CROSSTALK) DOOCY: If that's an option, yes. TRUMP: I should -- you know, that's terrible. I thought he liked me. I thought he liked me. (END VIDEOTAPE) DOOCY (on camera): And for the record, we did later tell him that if he goes up to space, he should come back to Earth afterwards. We separately had a chance to ask President Trump whether or not he plans to still reconsider daylight savings time ahead of the clocks springing forward on Sunday. He said that now that it's tough, because he considers that to be a 50-50, issue. Shannon. BREAM: All right. But Peter, if he goes, are you going with them? DOOCY: Does that count as like a foreign trip with the White House? Sure. Yes. BREAM: There might be some combat pay involves. All right. Peter Doocy, live from the White House Thank you, Peter. DOOCY: Yes. BREAM: So, a second federal judge has extended a block barring the Trump administration from freezing grants and loans, potentially totaling trillions of dollars. District Court Judge John McConnell, says the executive branch was trying to put itself above Congress. He says that undermines the distinct constitutional rules of each branch of our governments. The fired head of the Special Counsel's Office is giving up the fight to keep his job. Hampton Dellinger made the announcement a day after a federal appeals court in Washington sided with the Trump administration. Dellinger was expected to take his case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, but acknowledged that his odds of prevailing were not good. Also tonight, a federal judge has ruled the president's dismissal of a member of the National Labor Relations Board was unlawful. The judge says Gwen Wilcox must be allowed to continue in her role.

Republicans shouted back, kicked them out. Democrat leader Hakeem Jeffries, blasting the GOP. REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): Everything they do is a big, massive distraction. HASNIE (voice over): Still, 10 House Democrats voted with Republicans to censure Green, including Congresswoman Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, from a swing district, explaining on X, ""Congress should respect the co-equal office of the presidency, and stop with the theatrics at these events."" JOHNSON: The party is in disarray, so they debase themselves by showing up on the House floor and acting like children. It's sad. HASNIE (voice over): Democrats are unified against Elon Musk and DOGE. Dunking on Republicans for nixing in-person town halls amid complaints over federal layoffs. Republicans say Democrats are paying activists. POLITICO reports, Musk told the House GOP conference, Wednesday night that DOGE, ""Can't bat a thousand all the time, but that he'll try to fix any errors. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Should Congress have a vote on this? Should Congress have a vote on this? MUSK: Well, they do. HASNIE (voice over): As for his biggest critics, like Senator Elissa Slotkin, who called him out by name during Tuesday's democratic rebuttal. HASNIE: What do you want to say to Elissa Slotkin? She called you out by name? MUSK: I don't know who she is. (END VIDEOTAPE) HASNIE (on camera): And Shannon, that censure resolution wasn't good enough for all House Republicans. The House Freedom Caucus is now pushing for a resolution to strip Congressman Green of all of his committees, and Congressman Andy Ogles taking it further, saying that he'll do the same thing for all those Democrats that were creating chaos on the House floor today. Shannon? BREAM: All right. Aishah, we know you'll keep us updated from Capitol Hill. Thank you very much. HASNIE: Thanks. BREAM: So, investigators are looking into allegations of waste, fraud, and abuse at USAID. The acting head of the embattled agency is considering, he says, multiple criminal referrals to the Justice Department. Senior national correspondent Rich Edson is at the state department tonight. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The state department says it has uncovered severe waste and fraud at USAID. We've clearly got some problems. Problems so severe that Pete Morocco, the acting USAID deputy administrator, said in congressional briefings yesterday and today that he may refer cases to the justice department. Those specifics are unclear about the allegations, timing of any criminal referral, or whether USAID staff or grant recipients are suspected of wrongdoing. TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR: We are determined to correct those problems. Where it ends up is going to be, of course, something we'll see in the future. EDSON: A conversation with the American people in Congress. How about with the Department of Justice? BRUCE: Well, seriousness with which this is being addressed is something the American people should be happy about. EDSON (voice over): The administration is in the middle of a 90-day review of USAID and has paused most of its work. SEN. JOHN CORNYN (R-TX): Criminality involves intent, and we'll have to see exactly what was -- how this all went down. But the fact is, the money is spent in ways Congress never intended. EDSON (voice over): After leading a meeting with Morocco, Senator Jeff Merkley, told Fox, ""They are arguing they found some flaws in the aid system. So, they are going to tear the whole damn structure down. It's doing massive damage to U.S. interests in terms of our soft power."" The top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee says, ""If Rubio and President Trump were serious about addressing waste, fraud, and abuse, they wouldn't have fired the Senate confirmed inspectors general hired to investigate waste, fraud, and abuse.""

Dr. Marty Makary, spoke to senators today during his confirmation hearing. Correspondent Mark Meredith is on Capitol Hill with details. Good evening, Mark. MARK MEREDITH, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Shannon, good evening to you. Dr. Marty Makary has long been an outspoken critic of the FDA. Today, he asked senators to let him lead it, and it comes as President Trump calls for government agencies to overhaul how they have been doing business. The FDA has about 18,000 employees who work for it, and we know that layoffs are already occurring. Some lawmakers worry that these layoffs could leave Americans vulnerable to new health risks, impacting everything from medications to food. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. MARTY MAKARY, NOMINEE, FDA COMMISSIONER: If confirmed, I will do my own independent assessment on personnel. I welcome input on efficiencies at the agency. At the same time, I want to make sure that the scientists and food inspectors and staff central to the core mission of the agency have all the resources they need to do their job well. MEREDITH: Makary, until recently, served as a Fox contributor. He remains a pancreatic surgeon and researcher at Johns Hopkins University. Over the years, he built a reputation for speaking out against the medical establishment, including during the pandemic, when he suggested natural immunity could end lockdowns much faster than some other scientists supported. Democrats today repeatedly asking Makary if he would revoke approval of the abortion pill, Mifepristone for political purposes. Makary, says any decision on this pill will come down to science, not politics. SEN. PATTY MURRAY (D-WA): Lead to upholding the science and evidence-based drug approvals for all FDA approved products, including contraception and medication abortion? MAKARY: You have my commitment to come -- to follow the independent scientific review process at the FDA, which is a tried-and-true process. (END VIDEOTAPE) MEREDITH: The doctor says the FDA also should embrace artificial intelligence AI when it comes to reviewing data from clinical trials and studies, but he says humans still need to be very much involved in the review process for any new drugs. Shannon, we are expecting a confirmation vote in this committee a week from today. Shannon? BREAM: All right. Mark Meredith on the Hill. Thank you, Mark.

Chief National Security Correspondent Jennifer Griffin has the latest tonight from the Pentagon. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice over): China's defense budget is marching ahead, increasing by 7.2 percent this year, according to Communist Party leaders.

PETE HEGSETH, DEFENSE SECRETARY: We don't want war with China. We don't seek that war. We will. And the president has sought historic peace and historic opportunities, but my job as the Secretary of Defense is to make sure we're ready. GRIFFIN (voice over): The former Chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party reacted to the war of words. REP. MIKE GALLAGHER (R-WI): I think we should take all of this seriously, but the single best thing we can do is not like a tweet or a demarche or any other sort of nifty new program, it is to re arm as rapidly as possible. GRIFFIN (voice over): President Trump's pick to lead Pentagon policy raised eyebrows at his confirmation hearing when asked about whether the U.S. would defend Taiwan against Chinese reunification. ELBRIDGE COLBY, DEFENSE UNDER SECRETARY NOMINEE: I've always said that Taiwan is very important to the United States, but as you said, it's not an existential interest. GRIFFIN (voice over): Adding Taiwan should increase its defense spending to 10 percent of its GDP, up from its current spending of 2.5 percent. COLBY: The core American interest is in denying China regional hegemony. (END VIDEOTAPE) GRIFFIN (on camera): Meanwhile, Taiwan's leading supercomputing chip manufacturer, TSMC, announced it is investing an additional $100 billion to build three more semiconductor fabs in Arizona, doubling the number of fabs it has built following the bipartisan CHIPS Act.

CHARLIE KIRK, CONSERVATIVE ACTIVIST: Better ideas, Governor. LA JEUNESSE (voice over): So, Newsom promises more conservative voices on the podcast, and he admits Republicans are, ""Flooding the zone with content, policy and messaging. We can't as Democrats, he says, just sit back and play dead."" But what got Newsom in trouble with his base was this exchange where he says, letting transgender athletes play women's sports is deeply unfair. KIRK: You as the governor should step out and say no. NEWSOM: No, and I appreciate that. KIRK: And like, would you do something like that? Would you say no men in female sports? NEWSOM: I think it's an issue of fairness. I completely agree with you on that. LA JEUNESSE (voice over): Newsom also got blasted from the right for saying one thing and doing another. As governor, he opposes parents' right to know if their child goes by a different gender identity at school.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Every transgender inmate would have access. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Kamala is for they them. President Trump is for you. NEWSOM: Devastating. Trump's for you. She's for they, them.

One of the astronauts who has been stranded at the International Space Station for months is expressing high praise for President Trump and Elon Musk. Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are hoping to return home as soon as next week with the help of Musk's SpaceX. Tonight, his company is scheduled to launch eighth test of its starship rocket. Correspondent Jonathan Serrie reports from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Good evening, Jonathan. JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Shannon. We are now looking at live images of that rocket launching. It launched just seconds ago from Boca Chica, Texas, and so far a beautiful flight. Shannon, SpaceX has made some major improvements to starship's upper stage. In January, the spacecraft broke apart during a test flight, sending debris streaking through the skies of the Caribbean. SpaceX hopes to perfect this giant rocket to one day carry humans to Mars, which is on President Trump's wish list. But the company also owns the much smaller Dragon spacecraft model that launched to the International Space Station in late September with two crew members and two empty seats. Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunny Williams will use those seats on the return flight later this month after the next space station crew arrives. Thruster problems on their Boeing Starliner spacecraft turned an eight-day flight test into a nine month mission aboard the ISS, which SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and President Trump blame on the Biden administration. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: Biden was embarrassed by what happened. And he said leave them up there. I would have said if you are embarrassed, you got to get them out. (END VIDEO CLIP) SERRIE: Wilmore praised the president and Musk for their contributions to human spaceflight but said he believes the timing of his return is mission- focused. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BUTCH WILMORE, ASTRONAUT: Politics is not playing into this at all. From our standpoint I think that they would agree. We came up prepared to stay long, even though we planned to stay short. That's what we do in human spaceflight. (END VIDEO CLIP) SERRIE: Earlier today, Texas based intuitive machines commercial spacecraft Athena experienced an off-nominal landing near the lunar south pole. The company is working to work with NASA which mission objectives can be reached. This comes four days after another Texas company, Firefly Aerospace, successfully landed its blue ghost spacecraft on the moon. Shannon, NASA is trying to leverage these private companies to survey unexplored areas of the moon, places where they hope to start landing astronauts starting in 2027. And looking at this other private company SpaceX and their starship launch, so far so good, a beautiful view of the earth below. Shannon? BREAM: And always a sigh of relief when they're safely off. Thank you very much, Jonathan. Breaking tonight, a federal judge has ordered the government to process a portion of the $1.9 billion in foreign aid at the center of a legal challenge. They've got to do that by Monday at 6:00 p.m. eastern. This comes after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to let President Trump's administration withhold payments to foreign aid organizations for work they had already performed for the government. Up next, we begin our look at the timeline for how the coronavirus pandemic unfolded. And later, the panel on President Trump's tariff threats. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BREAM: Tonight, we begin a series looking back at the coronavirus pandemic, looking for lessons and accountability. In our first installment, my colleague Bret Baier takes us through some of the earliest days of the spread. BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Thanks, Shannon. It's been nearly five years, hard to believe, since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. More than 7 million people have died from the virus that originated, of course, in Wuhan, China. Tonight, we take a look back at the initial response to some of the first cases. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: I have a good relationship with China. We will see what happens. But I'm very happy right now. BAIER: In November of 2019, many of our top stories had to do with China. TRUMP: If we don't make a deal with China, I will just raise the tariffs even higher. BAIER: From President Trump's trade negotiations to protests in Hong Kong. And Bei Bei, the panda's move from Washington to a new habitat in central China. But in the background, a bigger story was taking shape. In the fall of 2019 scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology were studying how mice responded to SARS and MERS related coronaviruses. U.S. intelligence finds the lab maintains one of the world's largest repositories of bat samples. That fall a national intelligence report found several researchers fell ill with cold or flulike symptoms, but none severe enough to be hospitalized. It is unclear if those illnesses were linked to the virus that would soon spread around the world. By December, China's stock market was rising on hopes of a trade deal with the U.S. But in Wuhan, health officials were growing concerned about a new viral pneumonia that was not responding to standard treatments. Twenty- seven cases had been confirmed, seven of which were critical. The Wuhan health officials claimed the cases stemmed from a wet market. Some scientists assessed the market was a location where the virus spread to a wider group, and patient zero was likely infected from another source. DR. DAVID RELMAN, STANFORD MEDICINE: This laboratory that worked on bat coronavirus, which on the face of it was quite important for understanding these viruses, but had some risks. BAIER: In late December, the Wuhan Institute of Virology isolated and identified the virus from patient samples. Information available to U.S. intelligence officials indicates this to be the first time researchers at the institute had access to the virus's gene sequence. TRUMP: Hello, everybody. Happy New Year. Happy New Year. We're going to have a great year, I predict. BAIER: On New Year's Eve as President Trump rang in 20 at Mar-a-Lago -- TRUMP: I'm not sure you are supposed to say resolution out loud. I don't want to say what my resolution is because I think we jinx it, all right. BAIER: -- scientists in Wuhan were growing increase leg concerned about the new virus. They had isolated 59 individuals with suspected cases and transferred them to a designated hospital. The world celebrated the new year and even in most parts of China life seemed normal. But in Wuhan, the World Health Organization was moving in, and the Weinon (ph) wet market was shut down. GORDON CHANG, GATESTONE INSTITUTE: There are many unreported cases in China. There's also a number of cases in Hong Kong that haven't been reported. BAIER: What was now called the 2019 novel coronavirus had claimed its first victim by the time President Trump inked phase one of his trade deal with China. TRUMP: Right now, our relationship with China is the best it's ever been. BAIER: By then reports of cases outside of China were accumulating. The U.S. began screening incoming flights from Wuhan. DR. ROBERT GLATTER, LENOX HILL HOSPITAL: The bottom line is this is a very rare virus and the number of people that have been infected or exposed is very small. BAIER: Three days later health officials confirmed the first U.S. case. SATISH PILLAI, CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION: This is something that we consider to be of low risk to the public at large. But we want to be vigilant. BAIER: As more cases began to accumulate across the U.S., Wuhan and its 11 million people were placed in lockdown. TEDROS ADHANOM GHEBREYESUS, WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION DIRECTOR-GENERAL: It has not yet become a global health emergency. It may yet become one. BAIER: Shoppers raced to gather essentials in Wuhan as many locations throughout China closed to the public. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Disneyland, Disney Town, including Walt Disney Grand Theater and Wishing Star Park are temporarily closed now. BAIER: Roads emptied as train stations and airports shut down. Around the world, nations evacuated citizens from Wuhan. By mid-February, more than 1,000 people had died from the virus now known as COVID-19. TRUMP: We have had tremendous success, tremendous success beyond what people would have thought. Now, at the same time, you do have some outbreaks in some countries. Italy and various countries are having some difficulty. BAIER: Italy was the new epicenter for the virus. And by mid-march, 114 countries had reported more than 118,000 cases and more than 4,000 dea",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 we expect to see the number of cases, the number of deaths," and the number of affected countries climb even higher. We have therefore made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic. """"Pandemic"""" is not a word to use lightly or carelessly. (END VIDEO TAPE) BAIER (on camera): In the days that followed", the Trump administration would issue a travel ban for non-U.S. citizens traveling from Europe. All cruise ships would be under a no sail order. And the United States would become a global hotspot for the COVID-19 virus. In our next installment, we take a look at the early days of the health emergency here in the U.S. We'll send it back to you. BREAM: All right, Bret, brings back a lot of memories. Thanks so much. Up next, the panel on the tariff fight and Democrats in disarray. And then a very long and dangerous rescue mission. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BREAM: Breaking tonight just moments ago, SpaceX has lost contact with its Starship spacecraft just minutes after launch. We brought it to you earlier in the show. This is the second consecutive test failure. Now, this spacecraft is separate from the effort to bring those astronauts stranded at the International Space Station back to earth. This is not connected to that. But we'll keep you updated on future launches. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: This is very much about companies and countries that have ripped off this country, our country. Our beloved USA, and they are not going to be ripping us off anymore. RON WYDEN, (D-OR) SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: The Trump administration is driving America's economy into a wall, and typical families and small businesses are strapped in as the crash-test dummies. SCOTT BESSENT, TREASURY SECRETARY: President Trump's tariff policies have begun the process of reorienting our international economic relations. (END VIDEO CLIP) BREAM: Well, let's bring in our panel to talk about where we go economically from here, Real Clear Politics White House correspondent Philip Wegmann, Chris Ryan," host of """"New Hampshire Today with Chris Ryan"""" on WGIR and iHeart radio"," and """"USA Today"""" White House correspondent Francesca Chambers. Welcome to all of you. All right", Philip, I'll start with you. A bit of a whiplash today because we were told these big bad tariffs are not going anywhere. Was the intended impact to change policy in Mexico and Canada? We have got a reprieve until April 2nd on most of these. PHILIP WEGMANN, REAL CLEAR POLITICS: Maybe so. These trade wars are fluid things and the details are always changing. But one thing that is significant that I think we should note is the vibe shift coming from the White House. The rhetoric that we heard from the administration is radically different what we've heard from Republicans for the last 40 years. Think about it, in the Oval Office, President Trump says that he is not watching the markets. You have the Treasury secretary saying cheap goods are not the essence of the American dream. The Commerce secretary says their object is not to improve or have the markets go down by half a percentage point. I think their message here is that America was not made for markets, markets were made for America. The question is, how long can they try and use tariff to stop the flow of fentanyl across the border or to bring manufacturing back to this country before Wall Street has a conniption and goes haywire? BREAM: And today we know part of the conversation, we know that the president has been talking with north of the border, south of the border, all of the leaders. And Francesca, today the Treasury secretary called Trudeau a numbskull, saying if you play hardball with us it's really not going to work in your favor. So clearly some tense conversations still going on. FRANCESCA CHAMBERS," """"USA TODAY"""": And the president", as you noted, has had an on again, off again relationship, you could say, with these tariffs, looking ahead now to April 2nd. You asked about whether or not this is a strategy, which is what Trump advisers and close allies have said to me all along is that this was to try and get these countries to change their behavior. What he's more concerned about is trying to get companies to make products in America, to bring their businesses back to the United States. But that's not something that you can just do overnight. That's something that takes some time. So now you have seen the Trump administration react to that and try to give some companies a little bit more breathing room to get that done. BREAM: Yes, and Chris, that is consistently one of the things he said, you bring it back here and produce it in the U.S., you don't have tariffs. CHRIS RYAN, TALK RADIO HOST: And the next step, I think, has to be to push this out further. You look at New England as an example, we're going to see 20 to 40 cent per gallon increases in gasoline as a result of this because of the amount of petroleum that comes from Canada, increases at the grocery store. And this runs counter to what Donald Trump ran on, what folks were expecting. That is a reduction of costs. Do trade wars and tariffs have benefits? Yes. But we have to be able to build an infrastructure that will be able to support on the supply side what we need in this country in order to offset what we bring in from others. I'm not sure that exists in a lot of different sectors at this point in time, particularly when it comes to energy in New England. BREAM: So there is, obviously, the president has said there is going to be some disruption. He acknowledges that there are going to be short-term problems, but he believes this is a long term winning strategy. Somewhere else there's disruption. Here in Washington a lot of it with regard to federal funding," with regard to federal workers. """"Politico"""" says this about this meeting today with Elon Musk. It says he """"convened his cabinet in person on Thursday to deliver a message", you're in charge of your departments, not Elon Musk. According to two administration officials," Trump told top members of his administration that Musk was empowered to make recommendations to the departments but not to issue unilateral decisions on staffing and policy. Musk was also in the room."""" Francesca", how much is this about all this legal stuff that they are fending off at this point? CHAMBERS: It's both. And you had already seen cabinet members come out and pushback on this five things email and even tell their employees that they didn't originally have to do that. Then there's also the issue, as you bring up, of the legal battles. The president had said in his joint address to Congress that Elon Musk was the head of DOGE, which ran counter to some of the arguments that the White House had been making because he is not Senate confirmed. He is just a special adviser, special government employee, excuse me, the White House has said, which is a significant difference into whether or not he can tell employees that they have to go. But you heard the president again today saying, go with a scalpel. We are not necessarily going to be cutting huge categories of people moving forward. BREAM: Yes, and he talked about that to these federal agencies. We want to keep good people. We don't want to be cutting them, and let's be more precise about how we are doing this. While that is all playing out, over on the House side today they were talking about censuring, and they did, Congressman Al Green for the disruption we saw the other night at the joint address, the not state of the union. Here is a little bit of that playing out today on the House floor. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: House resolution 189, resolution censuring Representative Al Green of Texas. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The House has resolved Representative Al Green be censured. REP. MIKE JOHNSON, (R-LA) HOUSE SPEAKER: It was deliberate action. It needed to be met with swift punishment. And 189 Democrats voted against that. I can't believe that. That was the fest time in that any member of Congress has ever been removed in the middle of a presidential address, and it's shameful. (END VIDEO CLIP) BREAM: Given some of the crazy things that have happened on the House floor, Chris, it's hard to believe that's never happened before. But what does this say to you about where the Democratic Party is, the way they are going to push back on this current administration? RYAN: The Democrats are devoid of any leadership at this point in time. That's clear, whether it's from the governors, whether it's from mayors, whether it's from members of Congress. They don't have any leadership at this point in time. And what we saw during the joint session, what we saw today as well is they don't quite know what their message is at this point in time. But they are not in touch with what everyday people think and the process of which they engage in. People don't show up to work in color- coded outfits and be, hey, I don't like my boss. So we're going to have signs today and say -- no, people don't act like that. There has to be an element of reality that's injected within the Democratic Party, because one man has defeated millions of dollars worth of consultants and politicians over and over again. That's Donald Trump. He knows how to defeat them. He defeated them the other night. BREAM: All right, so Philip, I want to play a little bit of video from some Democratic lawmakers that came out today. There's some choose your fighter video. This is a trend, and get your reaction to this. If this is their messaging, will it be effective. (LAUGHTER) WEGMANN: So it was based, that match for the White House in response to that joint address. And this is just the cherry on top for the White House. The argument for Democrats has long been that what Donald Trump is doing is not normal. This type of reaction, I think it undercuts their case, and the White House would very much them like to continue this sort of thing. BREAM: I honestly thought it might be A.I. today, did not want to get scammed. But we think it's legit. So thank you, panel, very much. RYAN: Thank you. BREAM: Finally tonight, a SPECIAL REPORT salute. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, let me see. We come down. (END VIDEO CLIP) BREAM: Check this amazing bodycam video from rescue workers aboard a helicopter southern California. They were trying to get to two hikers who had fallen about 800 feet. The terrain, low clouds, high winds made it really tough to get to those hikers. Big challenge there. The entire group had to spend two nights in the snow, temperatures as low as 15 degrees. Finally on the third day, helicopters were able to get close enough to pull them out. Heroes all around there. All right, tomorrow on SPECIAL REPORT," a joint effort between Australia's Murdoch Children's Research Institute and San Francisco's Gladstone Institutes looking for new ways to treat pediatric heart disease. Thanks for watching SPECIAL REPORT. I'm Shannon Bream in Washington. THE INGRAHAM ANGLE is up next.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Have a great night, everybody. BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST: Happy birthday, Jesse Jr. JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Thank you. BAIER: Dad was a little salty on the show today. JESSICA TARLOV, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, dad was. BAIER: Thank you. All right, good evening. Welcome to Washington. I'm Bret Baier. President Trump's Justice Department seeks the death penalty against the alleged killer of a health care insurance executive. Did the Trump administration make a huge mistake deporting a Maryland man? An accused gang member to El Salvador? We'll have a fact check. And elections are underway in two states that could be indicators of public reaction to President Trump's agenda. Breaking tonight, we're just 22 hours away from learning the extent of President Trump's promised reciprocal tariffs on U.S. trading partners. He says there will be a huge spark for the American economy. Many of his critics dispute that. This evening, we're learning a little bit more about what those tariffs may include. I'll talk about tariffs and inflation with Austan Goolsbee, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, in just a few minutes. First, Senior White House Correspondent Peter Doocy starts us off tonight live from the North Lawn. Good evening, Peter. PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. Officials here are telling us the President Trump is open to taking calls from world leaders who are worried about these tariffs, but they're happening tomorrow as we learn that our nervous neighbors, Canada and Mexico, are talking amongst themselves trying to figure out what happens next. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KAROLINE LEAVITT, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: April 2nd 2025 will go down as one of the most important days in modern American history. DOOCY (voice over): The president will pick one of two pads, a new flat 20 percent tariff on all imports, or new tariffs that vary and match the tariffs other countries have in place right now. REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): You have to trust the president's instincts on the economy. DOOCY (voice over): Israel announced it has canceled all tariffs on U.S. imports, but global markets remain uncertain. DAVID NICHOLAS, FOUNDER AND CEO, NICHOLAS WEALTH MANAGEMENT: The market could easily be down another 10 percent if we don't get clear answers on this going in to make. DOOCY (voice over): The White House unbothered. LEAVITT: Wall Street will be just fine. DOOCY (voice over): Depleted retirement account balances are more of a concern. LEAVITT: Well, certainly they are legitimate concerns, and the president takes those concerns very seriously, and he's addressing them every single day. And tomorrow's announcement is to protect future generations of the senior citizens. DOOCY (voice over): Tomorrow's tariffs will cover many industries. Then Thursday, new auto tariffs that could raise prices on cars by summer. RITA CASE, RICK CASE AUTOMOTIVE GROUP: I think that within 45 to 60 days that all cars are going to have some impact on the tariffs if they keep going down this path. DOOCY (voice over): The New Democratic Party messaging, a play on words. SEN. ED MARKEY (D-MA): He calls it Liberation Day. It could be obliteration day if he doesn't act in a way that invokes the law of unintended consequences. DOOCY (voice over): But the White House projects trillions in new tariff revenue combined with DOGE savings and upcoming tax cuts will mean a much cheerier outlook soon. DOOCY: The president right now is with the trade and tariff team. They are very confident that this is all going to work. But what if they're wrong? LEAVITT: They're not going to be wrong. It is going to work. (END VIDEOTAPE) DOOCY (on camera): Also happening tomorrow, President Trump, in the Oval Office will view one of the final proposals for the purchase of TikTok, where investors could include Blackrock and Oracle, among others. President Trump told me last night that TikTok could also be used as a bargaining chip in tariff talks with China, Bret. BAIER: Peter, we've covered all the elements of the controversy over using Signal and all that exchange, but there's a new report about the National Security Advisor using private e-mail. What about that? DOOCY: Yes, we just confirm this with the National Security Council. Mike Waltz also used Gmail for some official business. The way that they're explaining it to us is that he received calendar invites from people. They refer to his legacy contacts, people that he knew beforehand, but they insist that he always CC government accounts for records keeping purposes, and they are telling us that he never did and never would transmit classified information on his personal account or any unsecured platform, Bret. BAIER: Peter Doocy live in the North Lawn. Peter, thank you. Stocks are mixed ahead of tomorrow's tariff announcement, the Dow lost 12. The S&P 500 gained 21, the NASDAQ was up 151. The Republican effort to put limits on judges, the party feels are exceeding their authority is tonight stuck in neutral and the hang up really has nothing to do with that particular issue. Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram explains tonight from Capitol Hill. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Republican implosion, some GOP members rolling House Speaker Mike Johnson, blocking the House from even debating a bill to rein in what they say are out of control federal judges. JOHNSON: Well, it's a very disappointing result on the floor there. All that was just wiped off the table. It's very unfortunate. PERGRAM (voice over): A revolt thwarted the House from considering the judge's bill, after Johnson tried to sidetrack a plan to go over his head, and allow members who are pregnant or new moms the right to vote from home. REP. ANNA PAULINA LUNA (R-FL): The body has decided that parents deserve a voice in Washington, and also to the importance of female members having a vote in Washington, D.C. PERGRAM (voice over): A stymied speaker sending lawmakers home for the week on a Tuesday. PERGRAM: But your message must not have gotten through to the members who are interested in the proxy voting when it comes to the Save Act, when it comes to the reigning in judges. JOHNSON: People have emotional reasons for doing what they're doing. PERGRAM (voice over): Democrats and Republicans tangled over the role of federal judges at a hearing. REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): This is the Judiciary Committee of the United States House of Representatives, and we should act like it. NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER SPEAKER OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: This is potentially a judicial coup d'etat. PERGRAM (voice over): Republicans wrote a bill to restrict judges from issuing nationwide court orders. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let me be clear, it should never have come to this. PERGRAM (voice over): But Democrats contend the GOP only wanted to harness judges because they didn't like how they ruled against the Trump administration. REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL (D-WA): So, maybe if you don't like the injunctions, stop doing the illegal stuff. (END VIDEOTAPE) PERGRAM (on camera): This comes ahead of a second hearing on judges in the Senate tomorrow. The Senate also has a bill to control judges, but it may not pass there either, Bret. BAIER: Chad, New Jersey Democratic Senator Cory Booker nearly at 24 hours now speaking straight on the Senate floor. Why? PERGRAM: Well, he's protesting President Trump. Booker is closing in on the record for the longest floor speech in Senate history. Now, Strom Thurmond spoke for 24 hours and 18 minutes in 1957. Booker could surpass Thurmond around 7:19 p.m. Eastern Time tonight. Also, Capitol Police arrested an aide to Booker for allegedly bringing a gun into the Capitol complex. Fox is told that Booker led the aid around a security checkpoint that violates protocols, Bret. BAIER: And just -- I mean, this is history, potentially, it's not technically a filibuster, because there's not a piece of legislation pending, but he could be a Black senator from New Jersey protesting President Trump with the longest time on the floor, passing the southern senator from South Carolina who was filibustering the Civil Rights Act, right? PERGRAM: That's right. That's probably going to come here in the next hour or so. Cory Booker has not indicated that he's slowing down. He's gotten some assistance here where he's yielded for a question to other senators, where they give a speech a little bit, five minutes, 10 minutes or something, and then they put a question on the tail end of that and yield back. It kind of gives him a time out. It's kind of like bringing in a relief pitcher from the bullpen. BAIER: Yes, pretty amazing. OK, Chad, we'll follow it. Thank you. PERGRAM: Thank you. BAIER: Tonight, we have an update on the case of a Maryland man deported to a Central American nation. In court, Immigration and Customs Enforcement admits it was a mistake, but there is more to the story, and the Trump administration is pushing back. Senior National Correspondent Aishah Hasnie has details from Capitol Hill. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) AISHAH HASNIE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Tonight, the Trump White House says it has proof the Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador is an MS-13 gang leader. LEAVITT: There's a lot of evidence in the Department of Homeland Security and ICE have that evidence, and I saw it this morning. HASNIE (voice over): That defense comes after a top ICE official admitted Monday that Kilmar Abrego Garcia had protected legal status that should have prevented him from being sent back to his home country. The agency blaming his removal on a, ""Administrative error."" Garcia entered the U.S. sometime in 2011 or 2012, he was picked up in 2019 for removal proceedings. When he asked for bond, an immigration judge found sufficient evidence to determine he was an MS-13 gang member and a flight risk and denied bond. He lost an appeal, but then filed for asylum, telling a judge he would be targeted by gangs in El Salvador. The judge did not grant asylum or allow him to stay in the country, but ordered that he not be deported back to his home country because of credible threats to his safety. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So, are you saying that it is OK to ignore a judge's ruling if you don't like it? LEAVITT: Who does that judge work for? It was an immigration judge who works for the Department of Justice at the direction of the attorney general of the United States, whose name is Pam Bondi, who has committed to eradicating MS-13 from our nation's interior. HASNIE (voice over): Democrats are painting Garcia as a family man caught up in the president's rash deportation policies. RASKIN: The guy who lives in my states, married to a U.S. citizen, with citizen children. He stuck with the dictator of El Salvador. HASNIE (voice over): While Vice President J.D. Vance firing back on X today about the left's framing of an illegal immigrant, writing he was a convicted MS-13 gang member with no legal right to be here. It's gross to get fired up about gang members getting deported while ignoring citizens they victimize. (END VIDEOTAPE) HASNIE (on camera): And Bret the vice president did get some blowback today for saying that Garcia was a convicted gang member. He was never convicted of a crime here in the U.S. In the meantime, Democrats are demanding that this administration bring Garcia back into the U.S., but the DOJ is arguing that it cannot do that because this man is no longer in their custody, Bret. BAIER: We'll continue to follow this. Aishah Hasnie live on Capitol Hill. Aishah, thanks. We have just received the latest border crossing numbers from the government, Customs and Border Patrol reports, 7,180 southwest border crossings in March, the month of March. That's the lowest monthly total in modern history. Works out to about 230 per day. Trump administration points out that the Biden presidency experienced more than 7,000 crossings in a single day several times. Breaking tonight, the man accused of gunning down a health care insurance executive in Manhattan may face the death penalty. Attorney General Pam Bondi has instructed her prosecutors to pursue capital punishment for Luigi Mangione. We get details tonight from Senior National Correspondent Rich Edson. Good evening, Rich. RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hi, good evening, Bret. Well, the Attorney General Pam Bondi says this is part of President Trump's campaign to stop violent crime. Bondi says the decision took careful consideration, and that ""Luigi Mangione's murder of Brian Thompson, an innocent man and father of two young children, was a premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America."" Mangione faces federal and state murder charges after prosecutors say in December in New York he assassinated Thompson, then UnitedHealthcare CEO. Police arrested Mangione five days later in a Pennsylvania McDonald's, he attracted supporters of demonstrations and on social media who said they saw the 26-year-old as a hero for allegedly killing an insurance executive. Bondi called Thompson's murder an act of political violence. Mangione's attorney says seeking the death penalty is political and barbaric, and that, ""By doing this, they are defending the broken, immoral and murderous health care industry that continues to terrorize the American people."" Asked about Bondi's announcement, New York Mayor Eric Adams deferred to the Justice Department. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ERIC ADAMS, MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY: It's in the federal prosecutor's hand. You intentionally went in and you took someone's life. It was a horrific act, and whatever process they put in place, I respect that process. (END VIDEO CLIP) EDSON: The Biden administration halted and significantly limited federal executions. President Trump promised to expand capital punishment, and this is the first time the Trump DOJ is asking for the death penalty. Mangione state charges carry a maximum penalties of life in prison. He's pleaded not guilty. The court has yet to require Mangione to enter a plea on his federal charges, Bret. BAIER: OK, Rich, thank you. Up next, the CEO of the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank on President Trump's tariffs, their potential effect on the economy and where the economy is tonight. First, here's what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. WFXT in Boston, where several people were injured this afternoon when a box truck jumped a curb and crashed on a sidewalk in front of a row of businesses. While still under investigation, city officials do not believe it was intentional, and are calling it a tragic accident. The rental truck flipped over and lodged against a building. Boston emergency services says six -- say six people were injured. One is said to be in critical condition. And this is a live look at New York from our affiliate Fox 5, one of the big stories there tonight, the city begins enforcing fines for noncompliance with its composting program. The initiative requires the separation of food scraps and food soiled paper into a dedicated compost bin. It was expanded across all five boroughs last October. That's tonight's live look outside the Beltway from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SCOTT BESSENT, UNITED STATES TREASURY SECRETARY: Can tariffs be a one-time price adjustment? Yes, I would hope that the failed team transitory could get back together and think that nothing is more transitory than tariffs if it's a one-time price adjustment. JEROME POWELL, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE: It can be the case that it's appropriate sometimes to look through inflation, if it's going to go away quickly without action by us, if it's transitory, and that can be the case in the case of tariff inflation. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I'd like to see the Fed lower interest rates. That's just my opinion. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Well, joining us now to talk about tariffs and inflation, Austan Goolsbee, president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. He was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers for then-President Barack Obama. Austan, great to see you. AUSTAN GOOLSBEE, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF CHICAGO: Thanks for having me back. BAIER: You heard Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in the Economic Club, talking about that tariffs could be transitory as opposed to inflation. He was making a statement there, but he -- what about that and how it impacts the economy now that we're getting ready for what the president calls Liberation Day tomorrow? GOOLSBEE: In theory, he is right. If you had a one-time tariff that increased the cost and stopped increasing them and there was no retaliation, I think it would be, as I say, in theory, a transitory increase in inflation. The only thing that when I'm out talking to businesspeople out in the seventh district, heart of the Midwest, they are raising that that theoretical doesn't feel like exactly what this is happening so far. You've seen other countries announcing they are going to retaliate, and it's kind of a stepping up, one upon the other, of tariffs, which would put us in the position where, if you saw inflation start to tick up again, we're going to have to figure out which part of the inflation increase, are you ignoring, and which part are you supposed to pay attention to it. BAIER: You're in a different job now. GOOLSBEE: Yes. BAIER: I just want to get your analysis of where you think the U.S. economy is tonight, you know, ahead of what we're looking at tomorrow. GOOLSBEE: Tonight, I feel like the hard data is still pretty solid. The unemployment rate is still low, the job market is strong, inflation has been in the twos' and on path coming down. If we could get past this period of uncertainty, I still think that the underlying strength of the hard data in the economy is still there. BAIER: You know, we had a fox poll on inflation. Is inflation under control in the U.S., now completely is four percent, mostly 13 percent. Most of it is somewhat or not at all, 47 percent. I mean, how people feel about the economy is a big part of it? GOOLSBEE: I agree. And that's the soft data looks very different from the hard data. You've seen businesses and consumers, confidence, sentiment numbers almost cratering. But that discrepancy between what the business people say and what the hard numbers show, it's about as big as it's -- as it's ever been in modern memory. BAIER: So, as you look, we're trying to forecast what the tariff fallout will be. As you're getting ready to vote on whether to drop interest rates. What factors into your mind? GOOLSBEE: I mean, the problem of tariffs is they're a supply shock. At the end of the day, imports are about 11 percent of the economy. So, tariffs on just a small sliver of the economy might not have a material impact on the macro in the macro sense. And in 2018, we had tariffs, inflation didn't go up. The fear is, if it jumps out of the 11 percent lane, and the way you do that are one of two ways, either the tariffs start applying to components and parts and intermediate goods, as the -- as the economist call it, and raise the cost of production for other industries? Or people start freaking out and change their behavior. And if the consumer stops spending or business stops investing, because they are uncertain or they're afraid where we're headed, that would be a bit of a mess. BAIER: For those last thing, who don't fully understand the Federal Reserve and how it operates and how you get to that point to drop interest rates or not, it is a vote, and there are a lot of you, a number of you around the country. GOOLSBEE: Indeed. There are some political appointees confirmed by the Senate. But of the 19 people sitting around the table, 12 of them come from the Reserve Banks out in the country, and they are not political appointees. There's a lot of input, and there are a lot of discussions that they're having with local businesses and civic institutions. The Federal Reserve Act says that when the Fed sets the interest rates, it's supposed to maximize employment and stabilize prices. And in this moment, I still feel like the president is in an environment where the hard data are strong, the best part about the economy, by far, has been the strength of the job market. And the worst part about the economy for several years, everyone knows, has been inflation and prices. And now, there is an uncertainty that people are expressing to us, which is tinged with a fear. They don't want to go back to the kind of inflationary environment that we had in '21 and '22, and we're just going to have to see how this plays out. BAIER: We appreciate you coming on. (INAUDIBLE) GOOLSBEE: Bret, it's great to see you. BAIER: Up next, off year elections in a pair of states tonight could have nationwide impact. We'll explain and bring you ""TEAM COVERAGE"". And later, Congress gets to the whole story on whole milk. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: There are a handful of key elections taking place in the U.S. today, a Supreme Court race in Wisconsin and two congressional contests in Florida. Both are seen as early indicators of how voters are feeling about President Trump and his agenda. We have FOX team coverage tonight, Mark Meredith in Daytona Beach, Florida, with a pair of races in that state that could impact the balance of power in the House. But we begin with senior corresponded Mike Tobin in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Good evening, Mike. MIKE TOBIN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. Now less than three hours left in this race that Elon Musk says could impact the destiny of humanity. It pits a liberal judge, Susan Crawford, against conservative judge Brad Schimel in this first partisan matchup since Donald Trump, or first partisan test, I should say, since Donald Trump returned to the Oval Office. The name people know from this race is Elon Musk. He says a redistricting case headed for the Wisconsin Supreme Court could flip the balance of power in the U.S. House and derail the Trump agenda. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ELON MUSK, PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER: All the president is trying to do is implement the will of the people. And they are trying to stop the will of the people through judicial trickery. (END VIDEO CLIP) TOBIN: On the left, J.B. Pritzker and George Sores opened their wallets to support Crawford. The candidates each accuse the other of being influenced by outside money. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JUDGE SUSAN CRAWFORD, WISCONSIN SUPREME COURT CANDIDATE: Engaging in shenanigans like paying voters to sign petitions and giving away $1 million to obviously preselected people supporting my opponent, I don't think that's democratic for a billionaire to use his wealth in that way. JUDGE BRAD SCHIMEL, WISCONSIN SUPREME COURT CANDIDATE: The groups that are supporting my opponent, that are funding her campaign, they are all in on that kind of woke nonsense. And Wisconsin told us on November 5th, they don't want any part of this. They want to end that. I'm running to restore this normalcy to our state. (END VIDEO CLIP) TOBIN: Wisconsin sends six representatives to the U.S. House. Four are Republican. The redistricting case flip two of them Democrat. The Wisconsin high court should also hear a challenge to a law from 1849, arguably banning abortion, voter I.D. will be challenged. So will the law that eliminated collective bargaining for state employee unions in this campaign. That's pretty much doubled the spending record from previous states of Supreme Court races. Bret? BAIER: Mike Tobin live in Wisconsin. Mike, thank you. Today's congressional elections in Florida are viewed as vital for the Republicans in maintaining their small majority in the House. Corresponded Mark Meredith is in Daytona Beach tonight with the latest. Good evening, Mark. MARK MEREDITH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Bret, good evening to you. Tonight, Florida Republicans are trying to defend their turf. The area where these two special elections are happening are in traditionally conservative districts. But Democrats are fired up. They are hoping for an upset as the party tries to move on from November's previous losses. The first race where we are in Daytona, we are seeing Republican State senator Randy Fine, he is a Harvard grad who founded a casino consulting company. He's running for the seat White House national security adviser Mike Waltz recently had, and he's been endorsed by President Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RANDY FINE (R-FL) U.S. CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: The president's message is very clear -- work hard and win. We are both entrepreneurs. We know what it's like to build something from nothing. And he's been giving me that advice, and I'm not going to let him down today. (END VIDEO CLIP) MEREDITH: Democrats are running Josh Weil, 40-year-old teacher back by Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. Weil says turnout tonight may reflect heavily on his effort to get out the vote. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOSH WEIL, (D-FL) U.S. CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: We've knocked over 200,000 Republican doors. We've knocked over 700,000 doors altogether. We've had half-a-dozen town halls. We've had huge events with live music. We brought the community out. (END VIDEO CLIP) MEREDITH: In the Florida First, the western panhandle part of the state, Florida financial officer Jimmy Patronis is facing off against Democratic gun-control activist Gay Valimont. This is the district that Matt Gaetz recently represented. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has urged Republicans not to read too much into the results because it's an off-year election, it's a special election. There's not a presidential name on the ballot. So turnout may be a little bit lower, and we'll know for certain, Bret, here in just the next little bit as the polls get ready to close. Bret? BAIER: We'll have those results here on FOX. Mark, thanks. A group of Democratic led states is suing the Trump administration to challenge its cancelation of $11 billion in federal grants. The money was allocated during the COVID-19 pandemic. State officials argue the Health and Human Services Department does not have the authority to unilaterally claw back funding the states had already built health programs around. Meantime, pink slips are going out at HHS. Notices of dismissal were sent to employees today. The layoffs are expected to total about 10,000. The Trump administration is looking into reversing a ban on certain kinds of milk for public school lunches. The rule may have been based on bad science, it turns out. Corresponded Alexandria Hoff has details tonight. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) ALEXANDRIA HOFF, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Got whole milk? Ask that question to almost 30 million U.S. schoolchildren and the answer is no. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't know where things got off the rails. HOFF: Since 2012, both whole milk and two percent have been banned in public schools that participate in the national school lunch program. It was an effort to cut down on obesity and saturated fat intake. But newer research suggests that dairy fat doesn't impact blood pressure, cholesterol, or weight in the ways previously thought. KEITH AYOOB, ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE: Can other foods lower bad cholesterol and reduce cardiovascular risk? Absolutely. But they can't provide the 13 essential nutrients in milk. Numerous systematic reviews have found that higher fat in milk consumption to be associated with lower childhood obesity. HOFF: Today, the Senate Agriculture Committee held a hearing to discuss reversing the ban. Versions of the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act are pending in both chambers of Congress. Overall, the legislation has received bipartisan support, but some Democrats are hesitant. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you know any major health groups that support this bill? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I can't -- I don't have information to that regard. HOFF: School nutrition programs are required to meet USDA standards set by the dietary guidelines for Americans. 2025's report released under the previous administration found that full fat milk may be associated with favorable growth and body composition in young children but declined to alter its low-fat recommendation. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. called the guidelines antiquated in a post last month, encouraging return to whole milk. (END VIDEO TAPE) HOFF (on camera): According to the USDA, only 34 percent of adolescents drink milk of any kind on a daily basis. That's down from 48 percent in 2006 and 78 percent in the 1970s. Bret? BAIER: Alex, thanks. Up next, what the Trump administration is saying about China's massive military drills near Taiwan. And then, the panel on President Trump's tariffs, my interview with the head of the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank, and what lies ahead. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: President Trump's nominee to be chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff testified at his confirmation hearing today. Retired Air Force General Dan Caine says he understands many see him as an unusual choice for the job. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. GEN. DAN CAINE (RET) U.S. AIR FORCE: I acknowledge that I'm an unconventional nominee. These are unconventional times. Our national defense requires urgent action and reform across the board. We must go faster. We must move with a sense of urgency. We can never forget that our number one job is to create peace through overwhelming strength, and if need be, fight and win our nation's wars. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: General Caine, nicknamed ""Raising"" Caine, has betrayed himself as a political individual. He would replace general C.Q. Brown, who was fired by President Trump. China is sending what it calls a warning and forceful containment against Taiwan independence. It is staging large-scale military drills around the island. President Trump is cautioning against any direct action. Senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot has the story tonight. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) GREG PALKOT, FOX NEWS SENIOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: China launching big ships towards Taiwan. An aircraft carrier, one of 19 naval vessels in the waters off Taiwan in the past day. Over 70 Chinese aircraft in the skies, along with troops and tanks, drills blockading and targeting the self-governed island China claims as its own. GUO JIAKUN, CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY (through translator): China's joint exercises are a serious warning and deterrent against Taiwan independence. PALKOT: Chinese propaganda videos portraying Taiwan's president Lai Ching- te as a parasite over an island in flames. Pro-independence Lai the stated target of these drills. Last month, he branded China a foreign hostile force. Taiwanese fighter jets drilling to defend. WELLINGTON KOO, TAIWAN DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator): Such actions by the Chinese have reflected their disruption of peace and stability. Clearly a troublemaker. PALKOT: The Chinese war games also could be sending a message to the U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth just in Asia, including Japan, where 50,000 American troops are based. He proclaimed the U.S. is committed to a robust and credible deterrence in the region, including the Taiwan Strait, words backed up today in Washington. KAROLINE LEAVITT, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The president is emphasizing the importance of maintaining peace in the Taiwan Strait, reiterating our opposition to any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion. PALKOT: All this as President Trump and the Chinese President Xi are still sizing each other up, including on the economic front. How far both are willing to go to the mat regarding Taiwan remains to be seen. ZACK COOPER, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE: What you're seeing is the Chinese trying to test out and see how committed the Trump administration is, and Washington may be looking for some signs from Beijing as well. (END VIDEO TAPE) PALKOT (on camera): In fact, analyst Cooper says China is not necessarily in the mood to invade Taiwan right now. Probably good for the White House, definitely good for the folks in Taiwan. Bret? BAIER: Greg Palkot in London. Greg, thank you. Up next, the panel on the Trump tariffs to come, my interview with the head of the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank. First, Beyond our Borders tonight. The Israeli military says it was targeting a Hezbollah terrorist when it struck a building in Beirut's southern suburbs earlier today. At least four people were killed there.

 the Vatican says Pope Francis is spending part of his days at his desk working as he recovers from double pneumonia. It says the Pope celebrates mass daily in his private chapel. The Vatican saying that Pope is continuing physical and respiratory therapy. Just some of the other stories Beyond our Borders tonight. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: The term I like best probably is the liberation of America. It's the liberation of this country. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: His wrath has made investors so downcast and so negative that people have just given up. They want nothing to do with stocks. They are sure the White House will keep laying on the tariffs that seem to be wiping out your wealth and my wealth. REP. MIKE JOHNSON, (R-LA) HOUSE SPEAKER: It may be rocky in the beginning, but I think this will make sense for Americans and will help all Americans. REP. TONY GONZALEZ, (R-TX): We could use this as an opportunity to get fair trade. I think it brings the cost down. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: A lot of talk about what the president calls liberation day tomorrow," the next iteration of tariffs. """"The New York Times"""" writes it this way"," """"Trump says he has settled on a tariff plan that is set to take effect Wednesday. One option examined by the White House is a 20 percent flat tariff on all imports which advisors have said could help raise more than $6 trillion in revenue for the U.S. government. But advisors have also discussed the idea of assigning different tariff levels the countries depending on the trade barriers those countries impose against American products. They have also said that some nations might avoid tariffs entirely by striking trade deals with the United States."""" With that", let's bring in our panel, Mary Katharine Ham," columnist for """"Outkick""""", Sabrina Singh, former Pentagon deputy press secretary, and Josh Holmes," co-host of """"The Ruthless"""" podcast and former chief of staff to Senator Mitch McConnell. OK", Mary Katharine, there's a list of options here. We are being told there are some countries that just won't see anything because they have a trade surplus, the U.S. does, with those countries. Israel today announcing that it's erasing any tariffs ahead of this tomorrow. What about this? MARY KATHARINE HAM, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I think that American voters are understandably upset about some unfair trade practices, particularly with somebody like China, and that they voted knowing that this was part of the package. However, if you have inherited a somewhat weakened economy from Biden or maybe a nascent recovery even, and you toss tariffs and uncertainty about the tariffs on top of that, you may end up handicapping yourself both economically and politically pretty quickly. BAIER: Interesting to hear Austan Goolsbee. He had a different job, Sabrina, in the Obama administration. Now he's in a nonpartisan Fed job as the head of the Chicago Fed. Here's his sense of the U.S. economy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AUSTAN GOOLSBEE, FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF CHICAGO CEO: I feel like the hard data is still pretty solid. The unemployment rate is still low, the job market is strong, inflation has been in the twos, and on path coming down. If we could get past this period of uncertainty, I still think that the underlying strength of the hard data in the economy is still there. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: The question is, after all this, do interest rates come down? And that's really what the administration, I think, is hoping for. SABRINA SINGH, DEPUTY PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY: I think also what he was saying is that there is a lot of uncertainty still. And that's why you are seeing the markets react the way they are. But not only that, putting tariffs on some of our closest allies, not just Canada and Mexico but looking to the Asian allies, putting tariffs on South Korea, on China, on Japan. Now we are seeing countries like Japan and South Korea move closer to China. For the first time on Saturday, they had an economic forum, the first time in five years. So if we are going to see our allies move closer to what this administration calls our pure adversary, China, that should be concerning. And that's what we also need to look at, what these cost of tariffs are going to do. BAIER: Josh, the White House is pointing out already the hundreds of billions of dollars of investment that have come since the talk about these tariffs. There's two ways it could go. It either works or it doesn't work. JOSH HOLMES," """"RUTHLESS"""" PODCAST CO-HOST: It's not a static conversation. It's very dynamic", as we found out in the first 60 days. Maybe a larger point is it's a part of a larger economic plan that's going to try to transition the American economy from a very artificial marketplace, propped up by trillions of dollars of government deficit spending, to a place that has little bit more stability. Now, markets hate that, right, because there's unpredictability involved. But it's no way to measure the long-term success of the economy. If your neighbor stole 20 percent of your stuff every day, it would be very easy to just never say anything about it. You could live in perpetuity that way. But at some point, you're going to have to confront that. And it makes a disruptive neighborhood presence. But in the end, you actually improve the economic health. That's what's happening here. That's a part of the negotiation. I expect it to be really dynamic going forward. BAIER: The other story getting a lot of attention, Mary Katharine, is this illegal immigrant that came over in 2011, lived in Maryland, sent out, said that he was a member of the MS-13 gang, sent to El Salvador. And now there are questions whether he was part of the gang or not. J.D. Vance, the vice president," put a post out saying that there are relevant facts regarding this man. """"One", the man was an illegal immigrant with no right to be in our country. Two, an immigration judge determined he was a member of the MS -13 gang. And three, because he's not a U.S. citizen he does not get a fully jury trial by peers. In other words," whatever due process he was entitled to he received."""" Democrats are pointing to due process and that if it's wrong", how do get this guy out? HAM: We can start with the fact that they say they made a mistake here and that they can't get him back. BAIER: In court. HAM: That he was somebody that had some protection because if they sent him back to his home country -- they could've deported him somewhere else with the process, but his home country, he might be in danger from gang retaliation there. So each of these is hard to parse out. Is he simply a Maryland dad. Is he a guy who was adjudicated as MS-13 by an ICE judge at one point? Or is he this guy with an asylum claim that's legit? But the thing is, we adjudicate that through due process, which he should have had access to before he was sent to and El Salvadoran prison in the home country where he had a protection order against. BAIER: And I asked Secretary Noem about this last night, and she said she was confident and the intelligence was there. The White House, Sabrina, kind of said they have seen the intelligence. They kind of have to lay it out, right? SINGH: This is what happens when you have this chainsaw approach to government. And I think what Mary Katharine said is exactly right. This individual and other individuals that are being deported, yes, there are some violent criminals in there. They should not be in our country. But there are people here that still deserve due process, and this is an individual that certainly did deserve that and now is in a state of limbo. How do you get this person back? And so unfortunately, I think there are going to be more cases like this. HAM: I do think American voters noticed that tens of millions of people came in during the Biden years, and that that ends up crippling our process, right. There are so many people to get out that going to the correct process is much harder, perhaps on purpose, but we still have to do them. BAIER: Because overall, on the issue of immigration, this administration is on the right side of the numbers, at least so far, Josh. You've got border for 7,000 for the month of march. There were days where there were over 7,000 encounters on the southern border in the Biden administration. HOLMES: No question about it. And I think obviously it complicates what they're trying to accomplish with this particular bunch of deportations. But as I've learned, and I think all of us have learned in the era of Trump, there's always a case that you try to use to undermine this larger mission that the American people overwhelmingly agree on. That message is we don't want violent Venezuelan gang members in the United States. What we come to find out there's always more to the story. And I think that will play out. This is clearly a complicated issue that they are going to have to adjudicate. The challenge is to try to keep that political message that American people agree with him, rather than having a legal message go out and have that be the discussion. BAIER: Quickly on politics, you've got the Wisconsin Supreme Court raised, two key races in Florida. Is it a barometer for Trump agenda, do you think? HAM: Our practice is to overread all -- BAIER: That's true. (LAUGHTER) HAM: -- election, so we will do that as soon as the results are in. But look, a lot of money was spent in Wisconsin. It's a very energized electorate. We'll find out which side is more energized. And in Florida, I do think it could be an indication that a lot of these House members who have come out might be facing challenges keeping the House with a very slim margin there in the future -- BAIER: Because Wisconsin and Florida, it has to do with the House majority and how slim it is, Sabrina. SINGH: These are ruby red districts. What I'm going to be watching is the margins and how close Democrats can close it. And again, these are special elections. I don't know that it's an indicator of what's to come yet. But let's see how these races go for the Democrats. They made the Republicans spend money. And the Democrats in Florida have raised a lot. So I think that's is something to pay attention to. BAIER: Elon Musk calls it existential. HOLMES: Yes, the Wisconsin race is a big one. It does have the capability of reshaping the map. Democrats, progressive liberals have made it a habit out of nationalizing Wisconsin Supreme Court races. And they've had some success doing it. This is going to be an interesting one to watch. BAIER: It's a purple state. Panel, thanks All right," time for """"Tuesday X-tras."""" First up is Brian. He asks"," """"Today being April Fool's Day"," have you played any pranks on any of your guests or coworkers?"""" No", I did not.

BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: I really enjoyed finding out where Gus politely peed. Thank you. All right. Good evening. I'm Bret Baier. Democrats say they are at war with President Trump and Elon Musk over the Department of Government Efficiency. Attorney General Pam Bondi hits the ground running with a series of directives aimed at fighting violent crime. And an investigative -- investigation into a theft ring at a New York City pawn shop could be linked to crimes targeting professional athletes. We'll take you there. But first breaking tonight, President Trump says the war on women's sports is over. A short time ago, the president signed an executive order to keep biological males out of women's and girls' sports. There's also new reaction tonight to the president's comments Tuesday about the U.S. ""taking control of the Gaza Strip."" Senior White House Correspondent Peter Doocy starts us off tonight live from the North Lawn. Good evening, Peter. PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. The president is going to try to pitch the U.S. takeover of Gaza to the King of Jordan next week. Remember, so far, Jordan is one of the countries in the Middle East that has said they don't want Palestinian refugees. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KAROLINE LEAVITT, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: This is an out of the box idea. DOOCY (voice over): The idea a U.S. takeover of the Gaza Strip. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I don't want to be a wise guy, but the Riviera of the Middle East. DOOCY (voice over): Democrats condemn the expansionist effort. REP. PETE AGUILAR (D-CA): An invasion of U.S. troops into Gaza would not make Americans more safe. It would make Americans a target. DOOCY (voice over): But that's not a sure thing. LEAVITT: The President has not committed to putting boots on the ground in Gaza. DOOCY (voice over): A Trump commitment on the campaign trail became the latest executive order today. TRUMP: The war on women's sports is over. DOOCY (voice over): Effective immediately, the new order prohibits biological males from competing against biological females for sports teams at schools at any level that receive federal taxpayer dollars. TRUMP: If you let men take over women's sports teams or invade your locker rooms, you will be investigated for violations of Title IX and riskier federal funding. There will be no federal funding. DOOCY (voice over): Shrinking federal funding overall, another top priority. LEAVITT: The long list of crop that this administration is cutting. DOOCY (voice over): A White House official tells Fox News, DOGE engineers are not uploading new code to government systems and have read only access but Democratic lawmakers want the whole project shut down. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): We have to fight this in the courts. We have to fight this in the Congress. We have to fight this in the streets. DOOCY (voice over): That will not include Pennsylvania Avenue. DOOCY: Are any officials here preparing to fight Democratic lawmakers in the streets? LEAVITT: Absolutely not. If you heard that type of violent enticing rhetoric from our side of the aisle, from Republican leaders on Capitol Hill, I think there would be a lot more outrage in this room today. (END VIDEOTAPE) DOOCY (on camera): The big concern Democratic lawmakers say they have is that this DOGE cost cutting project could somehow impact Social Security or Medicare payments, and we have no reason to think that that is going to happen. But today, Elon Musk did say that the Medicare payment system is where he thinks the, ""big money fraud is happening,"" Bret. BAIER: More on this with the panel. Peter Doocy live on the North Lawn. Peter, thanks. There is considerable reaction overseas, as you can imagine, to President Trump's statement about Gaza. Chief Foreign Correspondent Trey Yingst has that part of the story from Tel Aviv. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TREY YINGST, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Diplomatic shock waves are reverberating across the Middle East after President Trump unexpectedly announced plans for a U.S. takeover of Gaza that would include forcing Palestinians out. The idea was quickly rejected by Jordan and Egypt, countries the president says would take in displaced refugees. Saudi Arabia also denounced the proposal. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): The Ministry of Foreign Affairs affirmed that the Kingdom's position on the establishment of the Palestinian state is firm, steadfast and unwavering, and that this firm position is not subject to negotiation or outbidding. YINGST (voice over): That sentiment echoed on the ground inside Gaza, where Palestinian civilians spoke out about a potential forceful displacement of their people. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): Donald Trump's remark are illogical. We have lived through war for a year and four months, and then he comes and says, we should leave our land? This is our land and the land of our ancestors. YINGST (voice over): The new post war outlook for Gaza comes amid the backdrop of plans to curb Iranian support of its proxies like Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis. Iranian officials appear open to talks with the Trump administration, and through state media have praised Washington's revamp of USAID, signaling that even issues with the country's nuclear program can be resolved. ABBAS ARAGHCHI, IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER (through translator): I think maximum pressure is a failed experience, and testing it again will lead to another failure. If the main issue is stopping Iran from pursuing nuclear weapons, well, this is something achievable. This is not too difficult. (END VIDEOTAPE) YINGST (on camera): Iran's willingness for negotiations comes after President Trump's executive order on Tuesday aimed at denying the Islamic Republic the path to a nuclear weapon and comments from Trump that he left instructions to obliterate Iran if they assassinate him, Bret. BAIER: Trey Yingst live in Tel Aviv. Trey, thank you, President Trump's choice to run the Justice Department on the job tonight, Pam Bondi was sworn in this morning as Attorney General following her Senate confirmation last night, and she got to work fast. Correspondent David Spunt takes a look at some of the challenges she may face. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAM BONDI, ATTORNEY GENERAL NOMINEE: So help me, God. DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): With those words, Pam Bondi became the 87th Attorney General of the United States. BONDI: I will restore integrity to the Justice Department, and I will fight violent crime throughout this country. SPUNT (voice over): Bondi immediately ordered directives to fight what she calls weaponization of justice, eliminate drug cartels and lift a federal death penalty ban. TRUMP: I'm supposed to say she's going to be totally impartial with respect to Democrats, and I think she will be as impartial as a person can be. I'm not sure if there's a possibility of totally. SPUNT (voice over): Bondi will take over a DOJ plagued with uncertainty over the past two weeks. Today, Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove sent a follow up memo to the entire FBI workforce, criticizing acting leadership while addressing agents involved in January 6th investigations. Writing, let me be clear, no FBI employee who simply followed orders and carried out their duties in an ethical manner with respect to January 6th investigations is at risk of termination or other penalties. But he warned agents with, ""corrupt or partisan intent to be concerned about their jobs."" Last week, Bove ordered the FBI to distribute more than 4,000 mandatory surveys to determine agent involvement in the cases. The organization representing more than 14,000 agents is suing. NATALIE BARA, FBI AGENTS ASSOCIATION PRESIDENT: Because of a reckless decision, their names could be made public, putting them and their families in imminent danger. This is not about politics. This is about protecting those who protect us. (END VIDEOTAPE) SPUNT (on camera): There is a hearing tomorrow in federal court here in Washington D.C. relating to the FBI Agents Association trying to keep agents across the country from their names being on any public lists, Bret. BAIER: David, thank you. A federal judge is ordering a second nationwide pause on President Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship for anyone born in the U.S. to someone in the country illegally. Judge Deborah Boardman calls citizenship a most precious right. She says no court in the country has endorsed the Trump administration's interpretation of the 14th Amendment. This could head to the Supreme Court. The Central Intelligence Agency confirms to Fox News it is offering buyouts to its entire workforce. It's part of the president's deferred resignation policy unveiled earlier. A CIA spokesperson tells Fox the moves are part of a holistic strategy to infuse the agency with renewed energy, provide opportunities for rising leaders to emerge, and better position the CIA to deliver on its mission. Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine says there is no statutory authority that he can see for the President making this offer. While President Trump and congressional Republicans are trying to advance his agenda with considerable speed up on Capitol Hill, Democrats are having a tougher time coming up with a cohesive message on how to oppose him. Senior Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram shows us tonight. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Democrats are struggling to unify their opposition to the president. SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ): In the United States Senate, we will not cooperate. We will cooperate with no appointments when it comes to the State Department. SEN. ED MARKEY (D-MA): There should be hundreds of thousands and millions of people descending on Washington, D.C. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We must resist. We must be in the streets. PERGRAM (voice over): It only took two weeks for a Democrat to threaten to impeach President Trump. Texas Democrat Al Green prepped the first articles of impeachment against the president in October 2017. REP. AL GREEN (D-TX): I did it before I laid the foundation for impeachment, and it was done. Nobody knows more about it than I, and I know that it's time for us to lay the foundation again. PERGRAM (voice over): But two impeachments failed to suppress President Trump. Democratic leaders are leery of impeachment freelancing. REP. PETE AGUILAR (D-CA): This isn't a focus of the Democratic caucus. We've laid out our strategy, legislative, litigation, outreach and communication, and that continues to be the focus. PERGRAM (voice over): Democrats used to only have one target, President Trump. REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): They have no rudder, they have no vision. They have no clear leader. The only message they have is anti-President Trump. PERGRAM (voice over): But now there's a new foe who they peppered with inflammatory rhetoric. REP. LAMONICA MCIVER (D-NJ): We will not take (EXPLETIVE DELETED) from Donald Trump and Elon Musk. We are at war. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We have got to tell Elon Musk, nobody elected your (EXPLETIVE DELETED). PERGRAM (voice over): But at least one Democrat urges discipline in the line of attack. SEN. JOHN FETTERMAN (D-PA): Going to be a lot of balls coming down the plate, and I'm waiting for a strike when I'm going to start to swing. (END VIDEOTAPE) PERGRAM (on camera): The latest democratic gambit, an all-night session, which delays the confirmation of Russ Vought as budget director. Democrats can hinder the vote until Thursday night, but all this really does is put off the inevitable, Bret. BAIER: Chad Pergram live on the Hill. Chad, thanks. Gains for most stocks outweigh the drops for the Alphabet companies and some other big name companies following their latest profit reports. The Dow was up 317, the S&P 500 gained 24, the NASDAQ finished ahead 38. Up next, Brit Hume on President Trump's plans for Gaza and the speed at which he is implementing his agenda. First, here is what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. Fox 28 in Columbus, Ohio, with the arrest of a suspect in a workplace shooting that left one person dead and five others injured. New Albany police accuse Bruce Reginald Foster the third of opening fire at a warehouse where he is employed. Fox 5 in New York, is the National Women's Soccer League says it will establish a $5 million fund for players. It's part of a settlement stemming from allegations of emotional and sexual misconduct that rocked the league in 2021. The funds will go to players who experienced abuse. And this is a live look at Pittsburgh courtesy of Earth cam. One of the big stories there tonight, the U.S. Golf Association announces exemptions into the U.S. Open tournament for some players on the rival LIV Tour. The move makes the tournament the first of golf's four majors to introduce a formal pathway for golfers on the Saudi backed circuit. That's tonight's live look outside the Beltway from SPECIAL REPORT, we'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Investigators say the military helicopter that collided with that passenger jet last week was flying at an elevation of 300 feet at Reagan National Airport. A total of 64 people were killed on the plane, three in that helicopter. That will be part of tomorrow's briefing to senators by the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board. Two airliners collided on the ground in Seattle this morning. Officials in Seattle-Tacoma International Airport say the Japan Airlines plane struck the tail of a parked Delta Airlines jet while taxiing. No reported injuries there. Meantime, tonight, researchers say they have found the first evidence that a spine stimulating implant, already being tested for paralysis, might also treat neurodegenerative diseases, such as spinal muscle atrophy. They say the implant restores some muscle function, at least temporarily. They report three people with a muscle destroying disease were able to stand and walk more easily when an implanted device zapped their spinal cord. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're here this afternoon to change the course of history. After decades of division and conflict, we mark the dawn of a new Middle East. I hope that we could do something where they wouldn't want to go back, who would want to go back? They've experienced nothing but death and destruction. (END VIDEO CLIP) Well, President Trump's comments about taking control of the Gaza Strip have prompted wide reaction. Let's talk about how the new president is implementing his agenda and the reaction to all of that. Fox News chief political analyst, Brit Hume joins us tonight. Good evening, Brit. (CROSSTALK) BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Hi, Bret. A lot of reaction there, people interpreting what the president said, and what it really meant. The Jerusalem Post, interestingly, wrote this. ""Trump is beating the grass in the Middle East to startle the snakes in Gaza: If Gazans leave, then Hamas can't use them as human shields -- can't exploit, steal, and sell humanitarian aid. The concept of beating the grass will now stir up the Hamas snakes, and all the countries and NGOs and organizations that profit off the ruin of Gaza. They will come forward now, perhaps to fix the problem."" How do you interpret it? HUME: Well, I think it's such an exotic idea, and it's -- no, the obstacles are too numerous to mention, Bret. So, it may never come to pass, but it has had one notable effect, and that is, it has moved the discussion, at least for now, away from the idea of a two-state solution, which has been a dead end for a half a century or more. Now, the reason principally being that, while it makes all kinds of sense on paper, the Palestinians have really never shown much appetite for the idea. Most of them, I think, want a one state solution, and Israel not a part of that. And so, that, I think, is a great obstacle to peace. And, you know, Trump is offering something different, which he hopes would be an enticement to Palestinians to perhaps leave and or be made to leave and to turn the place into something that would be, you know, inhabitable, livable, and even a vacation destination. (CROSSTALK) BAIER: Yes. HUME: I don't know how far it will go, but I think it's, you know, it puts some of those other countries into position they don't like it, right? Saudi Arabia doesn't like it. The Egypt, and, you know, they are all complaining about it. The question then becomes, OK, that's our idea. What's yours? (CROSSTALK) BAIER: Right. HUME: And maybe they'll come up with something. BAIER: Yes. And listen, next week, King Abdullah of Jordan meets with President Trump. That's one of the countries, obviously, that would be taking in Palestinians from Gaza. He met today with Mahmoud Abbas, Jordan. Jordan's king did. And the question is whether this was a signal to Jordan, to Egypt, come up with something, otherwise, this is the back end. Obviously, there was a lot of reaction on Capitol Hill, Democrats, but also some Republicans. HUME: Yes, that's right. You know, the idea was bound to be met with all kinds of resistance, simply because it's so far out of the box. And you know, you look at countries like Jordan and Egypt, which don't want any part of the Palestinians. The reason, I think it's pretty clear, they saw what Palestinians have done in Gaza, and to some extent, in the West Bank, and they don't want those people on their land causing the kind of trouble they've caused there. But it's a -- it's a bit of a problem for them in terms of world opinion, because, you know, these are the nearest neighbors, and if they were cared so much about the Palestinians and their cause, they -- you wouldn't think they would completely close their borders to them, which is basically what they have done. BAIER: You know, since inauguration, we've had many talks like this about the drinking from the fire hose of all that's happening. Axios writes it this way, what Trump's thinking. ""Chaos isn't an accident. Trump and his aides know that the tsunami of ideas, executive orders and proclamations makes it hard for opponents to unite around a single message."" Are you seeing that real time with Democrats and the opposition? HUME: Well, there have -- Democrats having a terrible time for all kinds of reasons, not least of which, you know, their candidate lost in a very convincing way, which they did not really fully expect. They have no clear leader right now, and they are going to need new ideas to combat this administration. As for the president and this blitz that he is embarked on, I think there are two things at work there, Bret. One is, of course, when you're in your second term, and he is now, it isn't long before you become a lame duck and your powers begin to leak away from him. The other is, I think, that this administration, it's almost as if they were sitting there waiting to take power for four years. A lot of them were veterans of his first administration. They know how the government works far better than they used to. So, does he, I think, for that matter. And they arrive prepared to move quickly as indeed, they have done. BAIER: Brit, as always. Thank you. HUME: Thank you, Bret. BAIER: Up next, we examine who is coming across U.S. borders into this country, and where they're coming from. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Welcome back to SPECIAL REPORT. This week, Mexico and Canada both agreed to work on efforts to ramp up border security, avoiding U.S. tariffs, at least for the time being, for 30 days. Take a look at border crossings from the last fiscal year. More than 2 million migrant encounters along the southern border with Mexico -- the Mexico border, nearly 200,000 in the northern border with the U.S. border with Canada. As we look at the situation of where these folks are coming from, among countries that Customs and Border Protection keep data on, most crossing from the north are from India, actually, around 44,000. More than 36,000 were Canadian nationals. Canada has promised $1.3 billion for border security. It includes new helicopters, technology, 10,000 front line personnel and also appointing a fentanyl czar. Speaking of fentanyl. More fentanyl is seized at the southern border than the North. If you take a look at this. 21,000 pounds in the southern border and just 43 pounds of fentanyl, which is still significant, but much less than the southern border when it comes to fentanyl crossing., Cartels often purchase chemicals to make fentanyl from China, then, they smuggle that across the manufactured drug into the U.S. That opioid is blamed for more than 70,000 deaths each year in the U.S., some say up to 100,000 or more. Mexicans had the largest border crossing numbers in 2025 and 2024, with more than 600,000 encounters documented. They have agreed to send 10,000 troops to their border -- its southern border. Mexico and Canada are among the countries accepting deportation flights. Panama has also said they will have deportation flights using U.S. funds. Secretary of State Marco Rubio viewed one of those flights which deported migrants from Panama to Colombia. El Salvador's president also saying yesterday that his country will accept deportees of any nationality from the U.S. The U.S. is also dedicating more resources to the border, surveillance aircraft, collecting intelligence along the southern border in cities across the country. ICE raids that you are seeing day by day are ramping up as well. And we are getting new information tonight about the initial response to President Trump's immigration reform policy. Encounters on the southern border, as we have been saying, are down significantly. Immigration enforcement, however, appears significantly up. Correspondent Brooke Taylor shows us tonight. BROOKE TAYLOR, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Bret, DPS in Texas just released the number of illegal migrant encounters at the southern border overall in all nine sectors. That number continues to drop below 500. That is the first time in years. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) TAYLOR: ICE raids hit Denver and Aurora, Colorado, this morning. More than 100 members of the violent Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang targeted in Aurora, according to ICE. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You have the right to remain silent. TAYLOR: Similar scenes playing out across the country, in Seattle and in southern New Hampshire. The DEA says their multiagency enforcement operation targeted criminal aliens trafficking drugs. At the southern border, illegal encounters continue to go down and powerful cartels are feeling threatened. LT. CHRIS OLIVAREZ, TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY: It's a very volatile situation along the border, because we know for a fact the cartels threatened law enforcement, especially when it comes to decreasing the number of people on the border, when you are going after drugs. That's going to impact their profits. That's going to impact the cartels, and with that we can expect do see escalation of threats from the cartels. TAYLOR: The first group of 10 illegal migrants landed in Guantanamo Bay on Tuesday night. DHS says the illegal migrants are part of Tren de Aragua. They will be kept in an area used for migrants in the past, separate from the detention center where 9/11 planners are being held. SEN. TOM COTTON, (R-AR): Just an example of the kind of creative, unconventional thinking that the president has brought back to Washington to serve American interest, to get dangerous and violent migrants off of our streets and back to their home countries. (END VIDEO TAPE) TAYLOR (on camera): And ICE officials tell FOX News that they did make a handful of arrest in Aurora, Colorado, today. But their operation targeting more than 100 TDA members fell way short, all thanks to media leaks. ICE officials, though, say they are not going to let this stop their effort. Bret? BAIER: Brooke Taylor live in Dallas. Brooke, thanks. Two men are in custody tonight accused of involvement in the increasing popularity of burglaries involving wealthy and often famous victims. Correspondent Alexis McAdams has details this evening from New York. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) ALEXIS MCADAMS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: This New York city pawnshop now at the center of an investigation into a south American theft ring as police say the two men who run this store were buying stolen luxury items from a group who investigators say were breaking into multimillion dollars homes across the country. Sources tells FOX one of those homes belong to Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Someone is trying to break into the house right now. My daughter is there. This is Joe Burrow's house. MCADAMS: Burrow was out in the football field when detectives say a group of Chilean migrants broke into his house, then took off with some of his valuable items. JOE BURROW, CINCINNATI BENGALS QUARTERBACK: I feel like my privacy has been violated in more ways than one. MCADAMS: Police say the crew was in the country illegally, later arresting them during a traffic stop. This police body camera shows one migrant wearing Burrow's stolen Bengals hat, telling police they were on their way to Florida. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Where are you guys heading to today, sir? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Orlando. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Orlando? Wrong way. You are going the wrong direction to get to Florida. MCADAMS: Police say one of the owners of the pawnshop, Dimitriy Nezhinskiy, had been talking to some of those Chilean suspects. Now he and his co-worker Juan Villar, face federal charges for creating an illicit market and fueling demand for burglaries by these theft rings. As the duo remains in custody, the feds taking dozens of boxes of suspected stolen property in as evidence. (END VIDEO TAPE) MCADAMS (on camera): So here in New York City, Bret, those two suspects pled not guilty today in that court out in Brooklyn, but there's other open investigations into a theft ring that was targeting professional athletes for months. That open investigation includes Kansas City Chiefs star Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce. Bret? BAIER: Alexis, thank you. Up next, the panel on President Trump's Gaza plan and his executive order about biological males in girls and women's sports. First, Beyond our Borders tonight. Ukraine brings back 150 troops from Russian captivity. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced the latest prisoner swap with Russia. The Russian defense ministry confirmed each side exchanged 150 prisoners of war and that the freed Russians were currently in Belarus. And this is a live look at London. One of the big stories there tonight, scientists hope a mix of artificial intelligence with human expertise will help decipher ancient scrolls. The artifacts were carbonized by a volcanic eruption 2,000 years ago. Today researchers announced the generation of the first image of the inside of these one of these scrolls held at Oxford University. Just some of the other stories Beyond our Borders tonight. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When we asked about your proposal, a lot of people are talking about obviously -- DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: Everybody loves it. KAROLINE LEAVITT, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: This is an out-of-the-box idea. That's who President Trump is. That's why the American people elected him. And his goal is lasting peace in the Middle East. REP. PETE AGUILAR (D-CA), HOUSE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS CHAIR: It is very clear that what the president talked about would make our country less safe, it would make Americans a target. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Well, the reaction to President Trump's comments last night alongside the Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu that you saw it right here on FOX, a lot of reaction both in this country and outside of it. The headlines run the gamut, ""Trump's suggestion that the U.S. take over the Gaza Strip rejected by allies and adversaries alike."" ""Trump's Gaza shockwave stuns Middle East and some in the White House."" ""Trump campaign on ending foreign entanglements, now he wants to own Gaza."" Let's start there with our panel, Matthew Continetti, fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, Kimberley Strassel, a member of the editorial board at ""The Wall Street Journal,"" and Robert Wolf, CEO of 32 Advisors. Kimberley, let me start with you. First of all, were you shocked by the statement? And what about the reaction to it? KIMBERLEY STRASSEL, ""WALL STREET JOURNAL"": Well, I wasn't really shocked. And I think one way to look at this as a Donald Trump negotiation tactic. If you look what he is doing on foreign policy, he is a businessman. He makes big threats, big challenges. So you see what he did with the tariffs, and then he you get Canada and Mexico moving to do more at the border. He said maybe I'll take over Panama. You see Panama backing away from China, maybe offerings to work more with us. Maybe this was thrown out there not necessarily because Donald Trump wants to run Gaza, but because he clearly wants to see a different way of thinking among regional players about how to deal with the Palestinian problem. The status quo isn't working. So, I think this bears watching to see what comes afterwards and if the asks are, in fact, coming, and maybe the players then look at it and think, well, that's not as bad as having the United States running Gaza. BAIER: Right. And Matthew, the White House walked back, saying there is no specific commitment to U.S. troops on the ground in Gaza, there's no specific money allotted to Gaza. It does, conservatives obviously piped up, some of them about what he ran on, both this last time and in 2016. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: We're going to finally have a coherent foreign policy based upon American interests and the shared interests of our allies. We are getting out of the nation-building business and, instead, focusing on creating stability in the world. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: So, your thoughts on the statements? MATTHEW CONTINETTI, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE: Well, Bret, I don't think that President Trump was proposing nation-building in Gaza, or at least America doing the nation-building. What I think he was doing was presenting a vision for postwar Gaza. And many people have been asking that precisely that from variant governments around the world, including the United States. And what President Trump is saying is that if we really want a Gaza that is secure and not a threat to Israel and not a threat to the world more generally, then Hamas must not be a part of it, and that Gaza needs to be rebuilt in a way that ensures prosperity for the Gazan people and for other people that President Trump says might eventually live there. I think it was a bold vision. Obviously, the details will be worked out over time. But I also think it's another example of Trump challenging the conventional wisdom in the Middle East. He challenged the conventional wisdom with our embassy, moving it to Jerusalem. He challenged the conventional wisdom with proposing the Abraham Accords. And now he is doing it here with his vision for postwar Gaza that I think is, quite rightly, shaking everybody, including capitals in Egypt and in Jordan, which have kind of used the Palestinians as pawns in a larger game, and now can't do that any longer. BAIER: I mentioned earlier, Robert, that King Abdullah of Jordan was meeting with Mahmoud Abbas today. He will come to Washington next week. That is one of the linchpins to solving this problem. Is this, as Kimberley and Matthew suggest, shaking them up to say, OK, what do you have, and Saudi Arabia, too? ROBERT WOLF, 32 ADVISORS CEO: Listen, as the press secretary said, out of the box is an understatement. It really takes off the two-state solution which has been the U.S. kind of way for decades. I also think he walked it back a little today because, to Matt's point, he wants to extend the Abraham Accords. And the way he wants to extend it is bring Saudi in. And Saudi was very clear that if it's -- if there is not a Palestinian state, they won't be part of the Abraham Accords. But I do think that King Abdullah is coming. They want to hear what are you going to do in Jordan? What land are you going to give up? How are you going to rebuild? Obviously, a lot of people upset with Egypt with respect to the how they let refugees cross Rafah, or the lack thereof. So I think this is way to negotiate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 that, oh my God, what a great seaport this would be. BAIER: Piece of property, right. Yes, that's right. Kimberley, meantime the fire hose, as I talked with Brit Hume, continues to flow of stuff that is happening, executive orders, executive actions. And today the president signing this order about men in women's sports. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: We're putting every school receiving taxpayer dollars on notice that if you let men take over women's sports teams or invade your locker room, you will be investigated for violations of Title IX and risk your federal funding. There will be no federal funding. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: And the imagery there, Kimberley, with all these young girls around him as he signed that was quite something at the White House. STRASSEL: Yes, I think it's the most amazing image of this presidency so far. And look, I think this is a big moment, OK? It's not just that this issue is incredibly popular among Americans. This is a 90-10 issue out there. But it felt today, Bret, as though this was sort of the beginning of the end of this long period of cancel culture where there were so many people that felt that some of these policies were very, very wrong, but they were scared about saying anything for so long because of risk to their job, their livelihood, their reputation, what would happen to them online. And I think we owe a debt to some very capable women like Riley Gaines who really decided to make an issue out of this and embolden people to step up. And I think that that's one of the reasons Donald Trump was elected. Americans wanted to see more people voicing their concerns, and this was a big one. BAIER: Yes, and Matthew, it's true. It is about a 90-10 issue if you look at it, and it's also sweeping of any educational institution that gets federal funds. CONTINETTI: That's right. It's part of President Trump's agenda to use the executive branch of government in ways that really push back against woke, Bret. And when you look at the rise of DEI and political correctness over the past decade, it seems to me that the issue that broke it, the issue that started to shift back to the right was the gender madness, was this idea that biological men would be in women's sports. And so here Donald Trump is taking action, which is quite popular. And I don't think you're going to hear much dissent from any Democrats who understand that their party has been on the wrong side of this issue in the past. BAIER: Speaking of Democrats, panel, stand by. Up next, we will talk about the Democrats. They are definitely going after Elon Musk, but can they keep up with the Republicans and the Trump agenda? And then a bit later, a heroic rescue. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ROBERT GARCIA, (D-CA) HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE: You have a group of essentially young kids and Elon Musk running around. We have no idea what they're doing. REP. MAXINE WATERS, (D-CA): We have got to tell Elon Musk nobody elected your -- REP. DINA TITUS, (D-NV): If they can close down USAID, they can close down Social Security. SEN. CORY BOOKER, (D-NJ): We will not shut up. We will stand up. We will speak up. REP. MIKE JOHNSON, (R-LA) HOUSE SPEAKER: The executive branch of government in our system has the right to evaluate how executive branch agencies are operating. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Democrats say the resistance is back," and the USAID funding freeze and dismantling is causing it. """"Politico"""" writes in their magazine"," """"Democrats are falling for Trump and Musk's foreign aid trap. Relaunching the resistance to defend one of the least popular corners of the federal budget could be a monster miscalculation. Some prominent Democrats told me they have serious strategic reservations about how their party is fighting back. James Carville", David Axelrod, Rahm Emanuel agree the Democrats need to save their outrage for issues that will resonate with voters, cutting benefits, rising prices," not slashing foreign aid."""" We're back with our panel. Robert", what about that, that assessment of some of those Democrats and the pushback on the Elon Musk stuff? WOLF: Yes. So," I think the Democratic message has been pretty weak. I think yesterday when they were yelling """"We will win""""", I'm not even sure we think that's inspirational of what they are trying to win. In my opinion, they should work with the rest of Congress and make sure that the legislative branch is a co-equal and has the power of the purse. I actually think the idea of DOGE made a lot of sense, but I think it's just running, in my opinion, way too ad hoc, seems to be just throwing darts and see what sticks. I think it should be more prescriptive. I don't have an issue that they are challenging budget line items or programs like USAID, but it should be prescriptive. There are some things that make sense and some things that don't. And I'm surprised that all of Congress, both the GOP and the Democrats are rolling over when this is really the most power they is the power of the purse. BAIER: Right. Kimberley, I guess the pushback from Republicans is, one, that voters knew this was coming and they voted for it. And two, we always seem like we're one election away from taking care of the waste, fraud, and abuse. STRASSEL: That's just it, Bret. If there is one thing that nearly every American agrees on is that government is a problem. Slow, paralytic, fat, doesn't get stuff done, makes mistakes. And so the notion that anybody out there in America is getting unhappy that Elon Musk is coming in and breaking a bunch of China, I mean, people are throwing parties. And the weird thing about this is that Democrats think that they have got a message? This is not the hill to be dying on. The strange thing that I find about this party is that they don't seem to believe that they're making progress unless they are protesting and bringing down the other side. They have been given remarkable opportunity to try to get themselves straight with the voters on some positive issues that they believe in, and I'd think that they would using time far better than protesting against cutting USAID money for transgender operas in other countries. BAIER: Yes. And as far as the flow and all that's happening, here is Governor Pritzker of Illinois saying even the Gaza statement was strategic. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. J.B. PRITZKER, (D) ILLINOIS: He says so many things that are so far out of bounds. This one, let me just be clear, is dangerous. It's hard to tell when he's doing something just off the top of his head that doesn't really mean, trying to distract, often, perhaps from what Elon Musk is doing at some of the agencies yesterday, or if he is actually proposing something that's real. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: They are saying, Matthew, it's like look at the shiny thing over here. CONTINETTI: Right. You know, Bret, the Democrats have deep, deep troubles. When you look at recent polling, you see that the Democrats have record disapproval. The outgoing Democratic president, Joe Biden remember him? He left with a 39 percent approval rating. When voters are asked how did the country progress under Biden and Harris's leadership, voters tell pollsters that we went backward in a whole host of metrics. So, what I see pictures like we just saw top of the segment, it seems to me that Democrats have not learned anything from this election, and Governor Pritzker and Maxine Waters are not the answer to their problem. BAIER: Well, panel, thanks. At the beginning of this segment, there was Super Bowl ad with me and Sean Hannity, and a lot of fun. It was tough for me to wear the Philadelphia Eagles jersey, but there were also a lot of bloopers making that thing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: Do you want mow too look at Bret or look straight? BAIER: It's the cake that really sells it. So does he start the line after the cake? HANNITY: We should do this more often. (LAUGHTER) HANNITY: That was a good take. BAIER: That was. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: It was fun. It was good. It really was good. Thanks to Sean, and it'll run, the Super Bowl. Finally tonight, a SPECIAL REPORT salute. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (INAUDIBLE) (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: A New Jersey police officer rescues an 11-year-old boy who had fallen through the ice in the middle of a frozen lake. Patrolman David Brosonski is highly trained in water rescues as a water safety instructor at a police academy. He walked straight into the frigid water, grabbed the boy, pulled him to shore. A nearby resident also aided in the rescue by providing rope. That boy returned to school the next day. That's good stuff. Salute to you.

And all 80 people on board, they did make it out OK. My next guest is one of them. And here's the video he took of crews pulling passengers to safety. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: ... anything. Drop it. Come on. (SHOUTING) PETE KOUKOV, PASSENGER: Holy (EXPLETIVE DELETED). Holy (EXPLETIVE DELETED). Holy (EXPLETIVE DELETED). Oh, my (EXPLETIVE DELETED) God. (END VIDEO CLIP) PERINO: And Pete Koukov is here with us. We're so glad that you are with us. Can you take us through, Pete, what was like in the moments just before the crash landing? KOUKOV: Yes. Basically, we hit the ground and kind of just bounced up and turned on our side and were sliding on our side for a while, or, honestly, not as long as I thought we were going to slide for. And then we ended up upside down. And we were -- yes, we were hanging by our seat belts upside down for a second. And then, yes, we made it off safely. Everyone -- everyone is alive, thankfully. PERINO: And do you fly quite a bit into that area in the winter? KOUKOV: Not to Toronto, no, but I do fly a lot into places where there is variable weather. PERINO: Do you have a sense of what happened upon the landing? KOUKOV: Sorry, what do you mean? Just, like, what happened, or... PERINO: Did the pilot say anything? Was it -- that it was going to be a hard landing? Was there any warning? KOUKOV: No, there was no warning from the pilot. I -- there was no, like, physical warning either. I didn't feel, like, anything was wrong until kind of just, like, the second the wheels touched the ground, then it all -- it all kind of went mayhem from there. PERINO: OK. So -- and it seems that since -- we understand that 21 people were taken to the hospital; 19 have been released. So, thankfully, it sounds like everyone had their seat belts on. KOUKOV: Yes. PERINO: How -- can you just explain, how did you then -- how do you get -- unbuckle and get out? KOUKOV: I was able pretty quickly to, like -- so you're kind of just hanging suspended. I was pretty -- me and the girl next to me were pretty - - we were able to get out pretty quickly and kind of, like, climb -- like, sort of fall down to the ground, which was the ceiling. And then other people kind of needed some help. And people were sort of falling. But I don't think anyone -- no one was, like, hurt by getting down from their seat belts. PERINO: OK. And then, afterwards, you're outside. I'm sure it was extremely cold. You didn't take anything with you, correct? KOUKOV: No, I -- no one -- they were telling everyone to leave everything, as they should have. And then there was an ambulance or a fire truck that we kind of huddled. It was pretty windy. So we kind of, like, stood -- stood next -- on one side of that. PERINO: I'm going to show everybody here a timeline of the plane crash. This is leaving Minneapolis-St. Paul heading to Toronto. As you mentioned, all 80 passengers were evacuated. Around 4:33, Delta Air Lines released a statement regarding the incident. And then, at 5:00, pretty quickly Toronto Pearson Airport resumed accepting air traffic. What was -- what was your final destination? KOUKOV: Toronto. So, I left from Denver, and I had a layover in Minneapolis... PERINO: I see. KOUKOV: ... and then Toronto. PERINO: Well, we are certainly grateful that you are here with us and that you were able to join us and that you were able to get that video, so that we can piece together the story. And we wish you the very best. Thanks so much, Pete. KOUKOV: Thank you. BILL HEMMER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Well, calm cat. Happy to be home, right? PERINO: Yes.

He signed a powerful new law regarding illegal immigrants, a bipartisan law, and that law commits any immigrants who commit crimes in this country. And he has decided where he will put some of the thousands of immigrants being kicked out of the U.S. who could not be sent to their home countries. The White House is also trying to clear up confusion about the president's freeze on federal funding of some programs. Senior White House Correspondent Jacqui Heinrich starts us off tonight live from the North Lawn. Good evening, Jacqui. JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. The president made immigration and curbing illegal immigration the focus of his campaign. Now the first bill that he signs into law in his second term is aimed at that, named after the 22-year-old slain nursing student from Georgia. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALLYSON PHILLIPS, LAKEN RILEY'S MOTHER: He said he would secure our borders and that he would never forget about, Laken, and he hasn't. He's a man of his word. HEINRICH (voice over): President Trump signing his first law of his second term with the parents of 22-year-old slain nursing student Laken Riley looking on. The president declining to take questions during the emotional moment. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I don't think this is appropriate. HEINRICH (voice over): After his administration rescinded a memo freezing federal funds impacted by executive orders on foreign aid, American energy, ending DEI and immigration. It came after a federal judge temporarily blocked it from going into effect. The White House says the freeze will continue, but the injunction blocks communications between agency heads and OMB. And ""This action should effectively end the court case and allow the government to focus on enforcing the president's orders on controlling federal spending."" TRUMP: We stopped an attempt to make an illicit payment for illegal alien resettlement. We canceled $181 million in DEI training contracts. HEINRICH (voice over): But the legal battle may continue. SEN. PATTY MURRAY (D-WA): That means they are still blocking investments Congress passed into law to help our communities. Investments in new clean energy jobs and a lot of other projects funded by the bipartisan infrastructure law, which Trump is stopping with his illegal executive orders. HEINRICH (voice over): The president keeping the focus on the Laken Riley Act, which now mandates detention for illegal aliens accused of crimes including theft. Riley's killer was released after being arrested in New York. TRUMP: This is something that has brought Democrats and Republicans together. That's not easy to do. Laken did it. Laken did it. HEINRICH (voice over): The president today also moving to create a migrant facility at Guantanamo that can hold 30,000. PETE HEGSETH, DEFENSE SECRETARY: This is not the camps. You're not putting criminals in camps where ISIS and other criminals. There's a -- this is a temporary transit to humanely move illegals out of our country. (END VIDEOTAPE) HEINRICH (on camera): The president's memo says the space at Guantanamo, U.S. naval base should go to high priority criminal aliens. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem described it as a site for the worst of the worst. The Cuban president criticized this decision, calling it an act of brutality in an illegally occupied territory, Bret. BAIER: Jacqui, the president defended that funding freeze today, pointed something. His press secretary mentioned the briefing room yesterday that the administration had blocked $50 million in condoms for Gaza. That's a lot of condoms. What are the specific details here? HEINRICH: Yes, so the State Department said it was actually two buckets of $50 million that would have gone to Gaza through the International Medical Corps, it included contraceptives, as well as material for family planning and preventing disease transmission. That State Department officials said that condoms have traditionally been used for family planning in developing countries by USAID. The president also said today that Hamas have been using condoms to make bombs. Back in 2020, Israeli reporters sounded the alarm on this issue after Hamas began using condoms, balloons and also kites with burning rags attached as incendiary devices, Bret. BAIER: OK, Jacqui Heinrich live in the North Lawn. Jacqui, thanks. President Trump's pick to run the Department of Health and Human Services, weathering a storm of criticism from Democrats during his Senate confirmation hearing today, former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who ran first for the Democratic nomination, then as an Independent, was attacked for his positions or perceived positions on vaccinations, abortion, the food supply, what they called conspiracy theories. Republicans tried their best to defend him and asked some tough questions themselves. We have Fox team coverage tonight. Chad Pergram on the Hill looks at a big week for several of the president's nominees. But first, Correspondent Alexandria Hoff reports from Capitol Hill on today's contentious hearing. Good evening, Alex. ALEXANDRIA HOFF, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Bret. Yes, this was the first of two scheduled hearings this week, and Kennedy testified before the Senate Finance Committee here today, that tone was set right off the top. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR., HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY NOMINEE: News reports have claimed that I'm anti-vaccine or anti-industry. I am neither. I am pro-safety. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is a job where it is life and death. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Frankly, you frighten people. HOFF (voice over): Self-proclaimed disrupter Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was repeatedly disrupted by protesters and admonished by Democrats in the most tense confirmation hearing yet. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you supportive of these onesies? KENNEDY JR.: I'm supportive of vaccines. HOFF (voice over): President Trump's pick for Health and Human Services Secretary insisted that despite past statements of skepticism, he is not anti-vaccine. KENNEDY JR.: The only thing I want is good science, and that's it. HOFF (voice over): If confirmed, the former independent White House contender would oversee a $1.7 trillion budget, 90,000 employees and agencies including the FDA, CDC, NIH and Medicare and Medicaid Services. Kennedy says his make America healthy again pursuit would prioritize nutrition and shift federal research away from infectious disease towards chronic illness. KENNEDY JR.: The first thing I've done every morning for the past 20 years is to get on my knees and pray to God that he would put me in a position to end the chronic disease epidemic. HOFF (voice over): Today's testimony was also used by Democrats to point out Kennedy's past support for abortion, an issue that could give pause to several Republicans. SEN. MAGGIE HASSAN (D-NH): When did you decide to sell out your life's work and values to get this position? KENNEDY JR.: Senator, I agree with President Trump, every portion is a tragedy. HOFF (voice over): The 3.5 hour hearing concluded with cheers from Kennedy supporters and a Senate divide. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I understand their concerns about vaccines. I think Bobby put those concerns to bed. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He basically served up a big plate of word salad. (END VIDEOTAPE) HOFF (on camera): So far, there not have been any Republicans who have come out publicly and said that they plan to vote against Kennedy. Tomorrow's hearing will be before the Senate HELP Committee. A final vote on confirmation could take until mid-next month, Bret. BAIER: Alex, thank you. Well, tomorrow may provide significant challenges to a pair of President Trump's other top cabinet picks, Tulsi Gabbard, his selection for Director of National Intelligence and FBI Director nominee Kash Patel are up for confirmation hearings. Senior congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram has a preview tonight. Good evening, Chad. CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Bret, good evening. Democrats see Tulsi Gabbard and Kash Patel as radioactive. There's particular worry about Patel. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT): I think he's going to be eating a lot of his past garbage and backtracking very clearly on his extremist statements that I think disqualify him. PERGRAM (voice over): Fox has told at least six Republicans have reservations about Gabbard. Bipartisan senators wonder if she's trustworthy. A senior GOP source concedes confirmation may be tough. Others will decide by watching the hearing SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA): I've never met Ms. Gabbard. These confirmation hearings matter. I hope senators will make sure that the nominee is not a meat head (ph). PERGRAM (voice over): Vice President J.D. Vance says, if Republicans reject Gabbard, that's a, ""Insult to new GOP voters."" And all Democrats might oppose Gabbard, Kash Patel and RFK Jr., but some Democrats supported six of the seven nominees confirmed by the Senate so far. That includes Lee Zeldin to run the EPA. Democrats hope to stall the nomination of Russ Vought as budget director. That's due to the pause of grants and loans. MURRAY: This is a man who, time and again, has refused to say he will follow the law. Every lawmaker who doesn't want to see funds that they work to secure for their state, funds they know their families are counting on, ripped away, must vote no. (END VIDEOTAPE) PERGRAM (on camera): A Senate committee green lighted the nomination of Attorney General Nominee Pam Bondi this morning. Commerce Secretary Nominee Howard Lutnick had his hearing today, and the Senate broke a filibuster on the nomination of Doug Burgum to serve as Secretary of the Interior, Bret. BAIER: Cabinet is filling. Chad Pergram live on the Hill. Chad, thanks. Security agents escorted the Agriculture Department's inspector general from her office Monday after she refused to comply with her firing by the Trump administration. Reuters is reporting Phyllis Fong had worked with the Department for 22 years. She had intended to stay on after the White House terminated her Friday, she said she believes the administration did not follow proper protocols. The Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged today, it cut the rate -- it cut the rate three times in a row last year, from 5.3 percent to 4.3. Stocks didn't necessarily like that. They were down today. The Dow lost 137, the S&P 500 fell 28, the NASDAQ was off 101. Breaking tonight, former New Jersey Democratic Senator Bob Menendez has been sentenced to 11 years in prison. Menendez was convicted of accepting bribes and acting as an agent of a foreign government. Correspondent Bryan Llenas is in New York with the latest. Good evening, Bryan. BRYAN LLENAS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Bret, good evening. The 11- year prison sentence handed down against former Democratic New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez is the longest ever imposed against the senator in our nation's history. Menendez must report to federal prison by June 6th. Now, prosecutors had recommended that Menendez be given a 15-year prison sentence, noting that Menendez is the first senator convicted of acting as a foreign agent amid a slew of corruption charges. Now, after court today, an angry Menendez maintained his innocence amid reports he's now seeking clemency from President Trump. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SEN. BOB MENENDEZ (D-NJ): President Trump is right. This process is political and it's corrupted to the core. I hope President Trump cleans up the cesspool and restores the integrity to the system. LLENAS (voice over): In court today, Menendez cried as he begged the judge for mercy, a lesser sentence of no more than eight years. Speaking in front of his family, Menendez said, ""Every day I'm awake is punishment."" And that in his 50 years of public service, he has done more good than bad. Now, a jury last July convicted Menendez of 16 federal charges, including bribery. Menendez was found guilty of selling his influence to Egypt's government and to three New Jersey businessmen even attempting to interfere in two criminal cases on their behalf. In exchange, Menendez received gold bars, hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and a luxury convertible Mercedes Benz. The judge ordered he must forfeit all of it. Menendez said the gold bars belong to his wife, Nadine, who faces similar charges in a trial that starts in March. Judge Sidney Stein in court today told Menendez that he was successful and powerful, but ""somewhere along the way, I'm sorry to say, you became a corrupt politician."" (END VIDEOTAPE) LLENAS (on camera): Today, Menendez's two coconspirators, the two New Jersey businessmen were sentenced to seven and eight years in prison. Menendez says he's going to appeal this case, Bret. BAIER: Bryan Llenas live in New York. Bryan, thank you. Up next, Brit Hume joins us to discuss the rescinded federal spending freeze memo and the fate of the president's cabinet nominees. First, here's what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. Fox 32 in Chicago as a fight breaks out at a meeting in Thornton Township. Witnesses say a frequent critic of township advisor and Dolton Mayor Tiffany Henyard fought with Henyard's boyfriend. Witnesses claim Henyard joined the scuffle. Monday, former Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot presented findings from an investigation into Henyard's alleged misuse of funds. Fox 31 in Denver, as a Denver based Frontier Airlines makes a second bid to merge with Spirit Airlines. Frontier tried to merge with spirit in 2022 but was outbid by JetBlue. The Justice Department blocked that deal. Spirit filed for bankruptcy protection in November. And this is a live look at Salt Lake City from Fox 13 our affiliate out there. One of the big stories there tonight, scientists from the Smithsonian Institution say asteroid samples brought back by NASA hold salty remains of an ancient water world. NASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft returned the samples to the Utah desert back in 2023, the findings may support a theory that asteroids may have planted the seeds of life on Earth. That's tonight's live look outside the Beltway from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: An Air Force fighter pilot was taken to a hospital after ejecting from an F-35 jet just before it crashed at Eielson Air Force Base in Fairbanks, Alaska. Video shows the plane spiraling toward the ground, and then, exploding on impact. The cause of the crash remains under investigation. President Trump has signed an agreement calling for Meta to pay $25 million to settle a lawsuit over the suspension of his social media accounts. Those accounts were taken offline following the January 6th, 2021 Capitol riot. $22 million will go toward fund for the Trump presidential library. The rest will cover legal fees and other plaintiffs in the case. The Justice Department has abandoned all criminal proceedings against the two co-defendants of President Trump in the Florida classified documents case. Trump valet, Walt Nauta and Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De Oliveira, were charged with conspiring to obstruct an FBI investigation into the possession of classified documents the president took with him when he left the White House after his first term. Now, those cases are dropped. President Trump is appealing his conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records. The president's attorney is filing a notice of appeal today. They're asking the state mid-level appeals court to overturn last May's conviction. He was sentenced earlier this month what is known as unconditional discharge that left his conviction on the books but spared him jail, probation, fine, or other punishment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): Today, we saw what happens when Americans fight back against disastrous policies. Americans made their voices heard. Donald Trump rescinded the OMB order. Now, he should rescind the nomination of Russell Vought. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Russell Vought for OMB. There you see the Senate Minority Leader. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, issuing this clarification today. This is not a rescission of the federal funding freeze. It is simply a rescission of the OMB memo. Why? To end any confusion created by the court's injunction. The president's E.O., executive order on federal funding remain in full force and effect, and will be rigorously implemented."" With that, let's bring in Fox News chief political analyst, Brit Hume. You know, you need a white board at time here -- at times here, Brit, at the beginning, as you followed this. But basically, to sum it up, this freeze is -- was designed to scrub any funding going out the door for DEI or things that they specifically with executive orders targeted. It was not a blanket freeze, even though that's how many people took it. And there was a lot of chaos at the beginning, and for all of the politics, whenever they say Republicans pounce, this was Democrats pouncing on this chaos at the beginning. BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: It certainly was, Bret. And I think it's pretty clear that, that memo from OMB, which is a source of all this trouble, was pretty poorly drafted so that it could be read to be a sweeping blocking of funds across the government, social security, and other entitlement programs and all the rest of it. I don't think that was the intent, but the draft, it was fully drafted, and will now be redrafted. And I don't think the order is, as Senator Schumer was claiming, has been rescinded -- was been rescinded as Karoline Leavitt, the press secretary, pointed out, was a memo itself, which it was in need of work for sure. BAIER: You know, you look at the headlines, Brit, and obviously, this is a big one, because a lot of the media are following the confusion over this, and they were getting a lot of calls. ""Trump White House reverses course, rescinds freeze on federal grants."" ""Trump looks to repurpose federal money to expand school choice programs."" ""Trump administration to cancel student visas of pro-Palestinian protesters."" He just signed an executive order to open up Guantanamo Bay for a holdover for illegal immigrants who are not getting flown back to their countries. There is a lot that's happening, and this is just day eight. HUME: Yes. That's just a moment. It's been an absolute blizzard of statements, memos, orders, comments by the president himself, comments by his team. I don't think I've ever seen anything quite this dizzying, and his opponents are clearly caught off guard. And I think most of the things Bret that he has done are sufficiently popular with the public, broadly speaking, that even when Democrats recover their balance, they may have trouble -- it may be difficult for them to find ways to come back at him about these things. They may have to wait for more fertile territory later on. BAIER: Yes, I think, they thought they had it with this -- with this freezing, but may not have politically. Tomorrow, you have the confirmation -- another hearing, Pam Bondi, Tulsi Gabbard, Kash Patel. It's actually a confirmation vote for Pam Bondi tomorrow, but the hearings for Tulsi Gabbard and Kash Patel. And today, obviously, RFK Jr., Brit. What's your take about how things are going across the board? HUME: Well, look, I don't think Bobby Kennedy did made the kind of mistake you could make that would absolutely torpedo his nomination. I don't think he's out of the woods yet, but I don't think he did anything to hurt himself, particularly today. He did though the hearing got. I'm sure plenty of people are going over tooth and nail the transcript of it or the video of it to see if they can find something. I don't think he did himself any real harm, but I don't think he put himself out of trouble yet, and it remains to be seen whether he can make it. He remains a pretty controversial figure. He has loyalty -- he should have loyalty on both sides. He certainly has loyalty among Republicans these days, and not so much among Democrats, although he might once have had that since, after all, most of his life, he has been a Democrat, and I guess he still is. So, it's a little -- it's a complicated situation, but I think, you know, I think he's -- what I would say is he got through today. He got through it. BAIER: And we'll follow it all tomorrow. Brit, thanks. Up next, an exclusive look at President Trump's effort to ramp up deportation flights for illegal migrants. Also, I head to the touch screen to show you the numbers so far -- pretty staggering. And later, the panel on the confusion over the federal funding freeze, what that happens politically? And more in depth about the Robert F. Kennedy Jr. confirmation hearing, coming up. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAIER: Welcome back to SPECIAL REPORT. Vice President J.D. Vance says President Trump want to get illegal immigrant off the streets at a rate of almost 2,000 per day. The vice president spoke with Sean Hannity earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: Ten thousand in a week, the president is looking for, what, 1,800 a day. SEN. J.D. VANCE, (R) VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: That's right. HANNITY: And that's a pretty ambitious goal. VANCE: It's ambitious, but you need a leader who sets ambitious goals and actually holds people to meeting those goals. If you look at the number of illegal entries on January the 19th, the last day of the Democrats' administration, I believe the number was north of 1,300 illegal entries. Five days later we had already cut that by more than 60 percent, and I guarantee we're going to cut it even further. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: You can see the entire Vance interview tonight on ""HANNITY,"" 9:00 p.m. eastern time. President Trump entered office last week and immediately declared a national emergency at the southern border. He ordered the expulsion of migrants without the possibility of asylum. Since then, the numbers are staggering. The numbers of migrants arriving at the southern border has dropped by more than 60 percent. New data obtained by FOX News Digital shows that more than 7,000 migrant encounters at the southern border in President Trump's first seven days, a daily average, 1,041. That compares to about 20,000 encounters in the final seven days of the Biden administration, averaging more than 2,800 encounters per day. Border Patrol recorded 582 illegal crossings at the southern border on Sunday. Our own Bill Melugin says he has never seen a number this low. In Biden's final week, the crossings were in the range of 1,200 to 1,400 per day. Now, in Del Rio section, very active section here in Texas, there were just, let's see, 60, six-zero, encounters total illegal crossings. To put that in perspective, at the height of the border cris in December of 2023, some days in the Del Rio sector saw more than 4,000 encounters along this sector of the border. So it's a big, big shift. Now, if we continue on the Trump administration under this administration, ICE is reporting about 1,000 arrests per day. We don't yet have the total return and removal data, known as repatriates, for the Trump administration. It's not an apples to apples comparison, but there were 5.2 million repatriations during the Obama administration, more than 1,700 per day. Now, illegal immigrants are being sent back to several countries, about 201 to Colombia. We saw the back and forth with Colombia. At least 2,000 illegal immigrants have been deported to Mexico, both on the ground and in the air. Brazil accepted 88 on one flight. Guatemala has taken back 224 on three flights. And Ecuador has accepted a repatriation flight today, dozens of illegal migrants on board. Now, in a FOX News exclusive tonight, we take you on that flight, transporting illegal migrants back to Ecuador. Correspondent Brooke Taylor shows us this evening from El Paso. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Any regrets coming into the United States illegally? BROOKE TAYLOR, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: FOX News got exclusive access to the latest repatriation flight from El Paso to Ecuador, dozens of illegal migrants loaded onto the C-17. HAMID NIKSERESHT, U.S. BORDER PATROL: Not today. Not today, not tomorrow, not next week. Do not come to the United States and enter illegally. TAYLOR: Border Patrol tells us these illegal migrants were already in their custody, either crossing the border illegally or found in stash houses. Expedited removal flights are not new, but now President Trump is using military planes to ramp up efforts. This is the second largest plane the Air Force has. It's going to fit 80 of these illegal migrants. Border Patrol says the message is if you come into the United States illegally, you will be sent back to your home country. NIKSERESHT: Once you are found amenable to removal under Title A, we can have you back in your home country within seven hours. TAYLOR: Separately, ICE has been busy clearing criminal illegal migrants off the streets in major cities like Boston, Chicago, New York City, and Denver, where they arrested a suspected Tren de Aragua gang member overnight. ICE says they arrested more than 1,000 migrants on Tuesday alone. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson calling it a scare tactic. MAYOR BRANDON JOHNSON, (D) CHICAGO: There's a real goal here to stoke fear into the American people. TAYLOR: DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, who joined ICE raids in New York City, slamming back at Democratic leaders. KRISTI NOEM, HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: That's exactly what these Democrat leaders are saying, is we want to protect the cartels. We want to protect the gangs. (END VIDEO TAPE) TAYLOR (on camera): And the DHS secretary also announcing a first on ""FOX & FRIENDS,"" that today the Trump administration ended the temporary protected status for all Venezuelans, Bret. BAIER: Brooke, thank you. An Israeli official says Hamas will release three Israelis and five Thai nationals in the next hostage release scheduled for tomorrow. The Israelis are two women and an 80-year-old man. The release is part of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that has paused the war in Gaza in exchange for freedom for dozens of hostages held in Palestinian territory and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Up next, the panel on the Robert F. Kennedy Jr. confirmation hearing. First, Beyond our Borders tonight. The leader of the former rebel group that toppled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad last month is now the country's interim president. Ahmed al-Sharaa was appointed following a meeting of former insurgent factions. He will be authorized to form a temporary legislative council until a new constitution can be drafted. Al- Sharaa previously was linked to the terror group Al-Qaeda. North Korean state media reports leader Kim Jong-un inspected a facility that produces nuclear material. He called for bolstering the country's nuclear fighting capability today. At least 30 people are killed and many more injured in a stampede at the world's largest religious gathering. Millions of pilgrims rushed to dip in sacred waters in the festival in northern India. And this is a live look at New Taipei City in Taiwan, courtesy of Earth Cam. One of the big stories there tonight, wisps and clouds of smoke rise into the air at Buddhist and Taoist temples around Asia as people light incense to pray for good luck in the year of the snake. Ethnic Chinese flock to temples across north and southeast Asia on what was the lunar new year, the first year of the year of the snake in the Chinese Zodiac. Just some of the other stories Beyond our Borders tonight. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR., HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY NOMINEE: Should I be so privileged as to be confirmed, we will make sure our tax dollars support healthy foods. We will scrutinize the chemical additives in our food supply. We will remove financial conflicts of interest from our agencies. We will create an honest, unbiased gold standard science at HHS. We will reverse the chronic disease epidemic and put the nation back on the road to good health. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Some of these confirmation hearings have been fiery. This was one of them. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RON WYDEN, (D-OR) SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE: It's time to make sure that we blow the whistle on actually what your views are. ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR., HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY NOMINEE: I support the measles vaccine. I support the polio vaccine. SEN. THOM TILLIS, (R-NC) SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE: Are you a conspiracy theorist? KENNEDY: That is a pejorative, Senator, that's applied to me, mainly to keep me from asking difficult questions of powerful interests. SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, (I-VT) SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE: You talked about government should not tell a woman what she can do with her own body. KENNEDY: I believe and I have always believed that every abortion is a tragedy. SEN. ROGER MARSHALL, (R-KS) SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE: What is your prescription to help make America healthy again? KENNEDY: We need to fix our food supply. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: With that, let's bring in our panel, Jason Riley, ""Wall Street Journal"" columnist and senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, Matthew Continetti, fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, and ""USA Today"" White House correspondent Francesca Chambers. Francesca, we are just not at institute. We should, I mean, these guys -- (LAUGHTER) BAIER: Anyway, let's talk about this hearing today and what you took away from it and what his chances are? FRANCESCA CHAMBERS, ""USA TODAY"": Well, Democrats were already pretty opposed to him. You heard what they had to say in those clips. And that's what they have been saying leading into this. They are also pretty convinced that, unless Bill Cassidy or someone else comes out of the woodwork here to vote against him, even with the three Republicans, you know, who voted against Pete Hegseth the other day and, therefore, needed J.D. Vance to be a tiebreaker, that he would get passed. BAIER: I saw online, Jason, that there was a lot of focus on the spending of pharmaceutical companies lobbying lawmakers, specifically the senators on this hearing. And you look at the chart, and it's in the hundreds of millions of dollars every year. This is a shakeup move. He's clearly said some things in the past that those senators were pointing back to. JASON RILEY, COLUMNIST, ""WALL STREET JOURNAL"": Some things in the past? BAIER: A lot. A lot. RILEY: You know, if Kennedy had been nominated by Democrats to be HHS secretary, how many Republican votes do you think he would be getting? Probably not very many. You know, Trump sort of brought this on himself. We know he is transactional politician. He said get out of race and I'll give a position in my administration. And so here we are. But I also want to put things in perspective here. HHS is not a top tier cabinet post. It's not secretary of state. It's not attorney general. Most Americans probably can't name the person Kennedy would be replacing. But public health is important. He's a Kennedy. HE has a big last name that people know. And he will have a platform. And he is a person who has spent a lifetime spreading misinformation and enriching himself and trial lawyers by spreading this misinformation. I don't think he's the right person for the job, particularly if we are trying to restore faith in government and faith in public health after a pandemic. I think we can do better than Kennedy. BAIER: Matthew, at the same time, he did help President Trump with independents and some suburban women. The Make America Healthy Again was very popular. When you talk about food and the things that kids are eating, concern about disease, it moves the needle. MATTHEW CONTINETTI, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE: Well, I think it's precisely because we had the pandemic and we had the experts during the pandemic be shown to giving us false in",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 to prescribing social policies such as the lockdowns and the school closings that Americans really rebelled against and now have caused such devastation to our students as we are seeing in scores just released today, that have given rise to this movement, the Make America Healthy Again movement that RFK leads. So, he enters this nomination vote from a very strong position because he has an independent constituency, Bret, a loyal following, and also because he has many bizarre beliefs, in many cases. But there's always going to be a group of people that agree with one of them. And you add them all up together, and I think you have a winning coalition. And I don't see any signs from this hearing that Republicans are ready to buck the president this time. BAIER: Yes. And the question is you have tomorrow, the hearings for Kash Patel and Tulsi Gabbard. You look at the writings of various newspapers," """"The Washington Post"," """"Gabbard faces close vote. Her approval by the Senate Intelligence Committee to be director of national intelligence is far from assured", according to two congressional officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the controversial nominee. She definitely doesn't have the votes right now to advance out of the Intelligence Committee," said a Senate aide."""" We heard that", too, about others that eventually did. But it seems like Tulsi Gabbard is the focus. CHAMBERS: She was always seen, based on what I was hearing from my sources, as the one or one of the ones that would be the most difficult to get across the finish line. She doesn't have the same relationships with Republicans as some of Trump's other nominees, and that's part of what is going on here. Even if they were uncomfortable with some of the past statements, they felt like knew them better as a person than they know her. So that would also be the case with potentially Kash Patel or RFK as well. BAIER: Here's some senators on Kash Patel. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Getting Kash Patel into the position to deal with the national security crises and threats that we face here domestically is absolutely critical. SEN. JOHN KENNEDY, (R-LA) SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: But I want to hear that Mr. Patel is going to go in and, in a fair and equitable manner. I don't want to hear that he is going to go in like a small earthquake and destroy the institution. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, (D-NY) SENATE MINORITY LEADER: Mr. Patel is not remotely prepared to serve as FBI director. He's a conspiracy theorist, a hard right idealogue, and openly hostile to the free press. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: And just when the tide seemed to turn was when Trey Gowdy came on this show and said he advocated for Kash Patel to shake things up in the FBI. Obviously, the FBI has been under attack for all the moves that have happened over the last few years. Your sense about how this is going to go tomorrow? RILEY: I think that there are some issues with Kash Patel, but of the people we're discussing tomorrow, I don't think he is the biggest concern for Republicans in the Senate, frankly. I think I would go back to gabbard as being a much, much bigger concern. You talk about her relationships with Republicans. One of the reasons is because she has this history of opposing policies, including the Trump administration's first term policies when it comes to a lot of foreign affairs. She opposed Trump getting out of the Iran nuclear deal that Obama got into. It's been disastrous. She opposed the killing of Soleimani. She has sided with Edward Snowden, a spy who gave secrets to Russia and China and our enemies. And she is going to be the head of 17, 18 intelligence agencies. There's nothing in her political history to me that suggests she is up for this job. And that will be the focus here. If senators want to hold their powder for her and give a pass to Patel and some of the others, I think they would be right to do so. BAIER: Strong letter to follow from Jason tonight. Up next, the confusion over the Trump federal freeze, and then a rare sight at sea. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENT: We are merely looking at parts of the big bureaucracy where there has been tremendous waste and fraud and abuse. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, (D-NY) SENATE MINORITY LEADER: When the Trump administration announced this awful directive on Monday night, we knew immediately it was shortsighted, disastrous, cruel," and dumb. It is clear that President Trump and his minions are feeling the heat. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: """"The Washington Post"""" wrote it this way"," saying """"White House reverses course", rescinds freeze on federal grants. The original White House order freezing federal grants, which became public on Monday, caused mass chaos and confusion across Washington. The Trump administration withdrew the order a day after federal judge in Washington," D.C. temporarily halted its implementation until February 3rd."""" Karoline Leavitt saying it's not a rescission of the freeze", Matthew, it's a rescission of the original OMB order, which they say was sloppily written, that created confusion. Bottom line, where are we? CONTINETTI: Well, the bottom line was this was the first real pushback the Trump administration has received since taking office on January 20th. And I think it's the exception that proves the rule, Bret. What's different about this Trump administration than the first one is that so many of these executive orders are coming out swiftly and they are coming out very well- prepared and well-planned. And so this OMB memo that caused such confusion yesterday seemed to have slipped through that process. But I think in a way it highlights how effective the other executive orders have been. On the very day that the Democrats were seizing this issue of the OMB memo, Trump signed a landmark order banning gender transition surgeries for minors. And we're not talking about that because that's an issue where Trump has the law behind him and the public opinion. BAIER: Yes, and it's obvious that Democrats have been searching for something, and this was their something. It was always said that Republicans pounce on big moments, the media writes it like that. This clearly was Democrats pouncing. They had three press conferences. They thought this was it. It doesn't seem like it's going to last that long, but we'll see. CHAMBERS: There is still some confusion, though, about what effect it will have. You pointed out the difference in the statements versus rescinding them, the memo itself versus rescinding the order there. And a court is still going to have to decide, the White House says that essentially the executive orders that the president has already signed, those can all go through, and that fundamentally what they are telling agencies is you need to implement funding that is in line with his other executive orders that he has already signed. BAIER: Yes, so if you're funding deals with DEI or deals with transgender something, something, something, we have the right to look at this and scrub it and see. RILEY: This is absolutely within the discretion of the executive to scrutinize these things and not just push, shovel money out the door without caring where it's going. And frankly, it's what Trump was elected to do. People are tired of waste and fraud. He has to be more detailed in what he is going after and what is included and what isn't included. So that was something of a self-inflicted wound. BAIER: Today, you've got an order to prohibit federal funding for schools teaching CRT or gender ideology, order to prioritize federal funding for school choice programs, memoranda to prepare migrant facility at Guantanamo Bay -- we talked about that earlier -- order to combat antisemitism, task force to plan America's 250th birthday celebrations. This is today. You wrote a piece that he's doing a ton. But you've got to be -- RILEY: True. Also, these are executive orders. It means the next executive can come in and reverse them. What I like that he has done, the Laken Riley bill. Legislation that's more lasting than these executive orders. I think that should be the model for this administration going forward, getting legislation passed. BAIER: And Laken Riley's mom was very emotional about that today. Panel, thanks so much. And finally tonight, a special day. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It was amazing. We were -- I mean, we are out there on the ocean every day, and all of us were taking pictures, had our phones up, drone like we were all very blown away, and it was a really memorable encounter that I won't forget for a long time. (END VIDEO CLIP) BAIER: Take a look at this. This is a miles-long cluster of more than 1,500 dolphins seen swimming across Carmel Bay in California. Nearby whale surveyors were mesmerized because this type of dolphin, the Risso's dolphin, typically travels in group only about 10 to 30. This is 1,500. Researchers said it looked like the animals were having a big party. Good on you.
